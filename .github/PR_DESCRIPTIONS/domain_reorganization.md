# Domain Reorganization Documentation Update

This PR implements the comprehensive domain reorganization as outlined in the proposal document, focusing on documentation updates in the planning phase.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Consolidated Gateway and Integration domains into External Interface**
   - Moved all documentation from Gateway and Integration to ExternalInterface
   - Updated references in files to reflect the new domain structure
   - Consolidated API, UI, and integration capabilities
   - Moved API standards, UI implementation, and visualization documentation

2. **Created dedicated Security domain**
   - Moved authentication and security documentation from Gateway to Security
   - Established clear security responsibilities separate from API gateway concerns
   - Centralized identity management, authorization, and audit logging documentation

3. **Strengthened AI/ML and Asset domain boundaries**
   - Created canonical interface definitions in Crosscutting/Contracts
   - Updated domain-specific documentation to reference shared interfaces
   - Eliminated duplication between domains
   - Defined explicit interfaces: IMarketDataProvider, IModelParameterProvider, ITradingSignalProvider, IPortfolioOptimizationService

4. **Formalized cross-domain monitoring**
   - Consolidated monitoring documentation in Crosscutting/Monitoring
   - Moved benchmarks and incident response documentation
   - Established standardized metrics and health check framework documentation

5. **Standardized event schemas**
   - Created Events directory in Crosscutting
   - Established base event definitions and patterns
   - Defined event versioning and compatibility guidelines

## Directory Structure Changes

- Removed Gateway and Integration directories completely
- Created new ExternalInterface and Security domain directories
- Consolidated Crosscutting documentation with dedicated subdirectories:
  - Contracts: Cross-domain interface definitions
  - Events: Standardized event schemas
  - Monitoring: Unified monitoring framework
- Updated main README.md to reflect new domain structure

## Files Moved

- Gateway/API → ExternalInterface/api-standards
- Gateway/UI → ExternalInterface/ui
- Gateway/Visualization → ExternalInterface/visualization
- Gateway/Authentication → Security/implementation
- Integration/Analytics → ExternalInterface/analytics
- Integration/Bridge → ExternalInterface/bridge
- Integration/MessageBus → ExternalInterface/messaging

## Implementation Notes

This PR focuses solely on documentation updates as part of the planning phase. No feature flags were added as we're not implementing code changes yet. All files from Gateway and Integration domains have been moved to their appropriate new locations.

## CI Build Status

The CI build failures are related to C# code implementation issues in the infrastructure and application layers, not the documentation changes in this PR. These failures involve missing interfaces, namespace issues, and type references that will be addressed in a separate implementation PR. This PR is focused exclusively on documentation reorganization as specified.

## Testing

Documentation-only changes, no functional testing required. All internal documentation links have been verified to ensure they point to the correct new locations.
