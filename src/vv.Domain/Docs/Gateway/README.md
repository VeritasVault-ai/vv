# VeritasVault Integration Gateway

> External Integration and API Management

## 1. Overview

Defines VeritasVault's foundation for secure external API access, protocol adapter orchestration, and automated integration management. Built for adversarial environments and rapid change: every API call, adapter, and bot is tracked, rate-limited, and auditable—no black boxes, no wildcards.

## 2. Domain Model & Responsibilities

### A. API Management Domain [NEW]

#### 1. APIGateway

**Purpose**: Gatekeeper for all external API access.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Create, revoke, and manage API keys and permissions
- Enforce authentication and role-based access control
- Apply dynamic, per-key and per-resource rate limiting
- Monitor, log, and alert on API usage and abuse

```solidity
interface IAPIGateway {
    struct APIKey {
        bytes32 id;
        address owner;
        uint256 rateLimit;
        mapping(bytes32 => bool) permissions;
        uint256 validUntil;
    }

    function createAPIKey(
        address owner,
        uint256 rateLimit,
        bytes32[] calldata permissions
    ) external returns (bytes32);

    function revokeAPIKey(bytes32 keyId) external;
    function validateAccess(bytes32 keyId, bytes32 resource) external view returns (bool);
    function updateRateLimit(bytes32 keyId, uint256 newLimit) external;
}
```

#### 2. AdapterManager

**Purpose**: Protocol adapter and automation bot manager.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Register, configure, and validate protocol adapters
- Register and manage bots and their permissions
- Orchestrate integration lifecycle and health
- Monitor, isolate, and upgrade adapters as needed

```solidity
interface IAdapterManager {
    struct Adapter {
        bytes32 id;
        address implementation;
        bytes32 adapterType;
        bool isActive;
        mapping(bytes32 => bytes) config;
    }

    struct Bot {
        bytes32 id;
        address owner;
        bytes32[] permissions;
        uint256 lastActive;
        bool isEnabled;
    }

    function registerAdapter(
        address implementation,
        bytes32 adapterType,
        bytes calldata config
    ) external returns (bytes32);

    function registerBot(
        address owner,
        bytes32[] calldata permissions
    ) external returns (bytes32);

    function validateAdapter(bytes32 adapterId) external view returns (bool);
    function updateAdapter(bytes32 adapterId, bytes calldata config) external;
}
```

### B. Integration Services

#### 3. IntegrationManager

**Purpose**: Orchestrates external protocol integration.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage external integrations and yield sources
- Coordinate multi-protocol and cross-chain execution
- Maintain compatibility and perform integration upgrades

#### 4. MessageBus

**Purpose**: Core event and notification delivery.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Route all events, notifications, and state changes
- Ensure reliable, ordered, and auditable delivery
- Maintain message queues with full event history

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### 1. API Security

- Enforce strong rate limiting per key/resource
- Require authentication (HMAC, JWT, OAuth2, or similar)
- Apply least-privilege access controls
- Log, alert, and block on API abuse or anomaly

### 2. Adapter Management

- Validate adapter logic and configuration before activation
- Monitor adapter health and isolate on error
- Enforce version control and rollback support
- Track/verify all config changes and upgrade events

### 3. Bot Integration

- Strict permission assignment and audit per bot
- Enforce activity, usage, and rate limits
- Monitor all bot resource usage and alert on anomaly
- Ensure all errors and failures are logged and reportable

## 4. Security Considerations

### 1. API Security Considerations

- Enforced rate limiting and DoS protection
- Mandatory authentication for all external access
- Role-based access and real-time monitoring

### 2. Adapter Security Considerations

- Full validation and isolation of each adapter
- Resource usage limits (CPU/mem/calls)
- Versioned upgrade and rollback policies

### 3. Bot Security Considerations

- Permission management and audit
- Resource usage and activity tracking
- Activity/usage caps per bot
- Anomaly/failure monitoring and reporting

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Weeks 1-2)

- Deploy APIGateway with rate limiting and access control
- Bring up AdapterManager, register initial adapters/bots
- Implement core access controls and monitoring
- Deploy core objects and events:
  - Objects: APIKey, Permission, AccessControl, RateLimit, SecurityPolicy, Adapter, Bot, AdapterConfig, ValidationRule
  - Events: APIKeyCreated, APIKeyRevoked, AccessGranted, AccessDenied, RateLimitUpdated, AdapterRegistered, BotRegistered, AdapterValidated, ConfigUpdated

### Phase 2: Protocol Integration (Weeks 3-4)

- Integrate protocols through IntegrationManager
- Deploy MessageBus for system event delivery
- Roll out end-to-end monitoring and alerting systems
- Deploy additional objects and events:
  - Objects: Protocol, Integration, YieldSource, ProtocolConfig, Message, EventQueue, Subscription, DeliveryReceipt
  - Events: ProtocolIntegrated, IntegrationUpdated, YieldSourceAdded, MessagePublished, MessageDelivered, SubscriptionCreated, QueueProcessed

### Phase 3: Advanced Gateway Features (Weeks 5-6)

- Implement advanced monitoring and anomaly detection
- Deploy cross-chain integration capabilities
- Establish automated health checks and self-healing
- Deploy advanced objects and events:
  - Objects: AnomalyRule, HealthCheck, CrossChainAdapter, CircuitBreaker, AdapterMetrics, BotActivity
  - Events: AnomalyDetected, HealthCheckFailed, CircuitBroken, CircuitRestored, CrossChainMessageSent, MetricRecorded, AdapterIsolated

## 6. Best Practices

- All API and adapter actions are logged, versioned, and signed
- No unaudited adapter or bot runs in production
- Always prefer explicit deny over implicit allow
- All rate limiting, authentication, and permission checks are unit tested
- "Works for now" is not allowed—only extensible, auditable code makes the cut

This is your API perimeter. If it isn't locked down, don't bother with the rest of your stack. Unchecked bots and adapters are just exploits waiting for a timestamp.
