## 2. Executive Summary

### Business Impact

* Facilitates secure, scalable, and auditable integration with external systems and partners.
* Enables multi-protocol, multi-chain connectivity and real-time analytics.
* Drives ecosystem growth via open APIs, automation, and external bot integrations.

### Technical Impact

* Implements API gateway, adapter management, and event streaming.
* Introduces robust rate-limiting, key management, and protocol orchestration.
* Provides extensibility for third-party integrations and yield sources.

### Timeline Impact

* Phase 1: API gateway, rate limiting, and basic adapter management for MVP.
* Phase 2: Protocol adapter orchestration, event delivery, and notification routing.
* Phase 3: Advanced analytics integration, monitoring, and automation.
* Phase 4: Full external bot lifecycle and state change propagation.

---

## 3. Domain Overview

The Integration Gateway domain acts as the controlled access layer between VeritasVault and the outside world—managing all external API requests, protocol adapters, bot lifecycle, and outbound event delivery. This domain enforces security, auditability, and scalability for every cross-boundary interaction.

---

## 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

### Core Functions

* API perimeter enforcement (authentication, access control, rate limiting)
* Protocol adapter and bot management
* Integration orchestration and lifecycle management
* Event, message, and notification delivery
* Audit logging of all access and integration activity

### Scope Definition

**In Scope:**

* APIGateway, AdapterManager, IntegrationManager, MessageBus
* API key lifecycle, adapter registration, event streaming, and integration upgrades

**Out of Scope:**

* Underlying protocol logic, direct asset/trading, user-facing analytics dashboards

---

## 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

### Aggregate Roots

* **APIKey:** Aggregate for all API key creation, revocation, and permissioning.
* **Adapter:** Aggregate for registered protocol adapters and their lifecycles.
* **Integration:** Aggregate for orchestrated integrations and state tracking.
* **Bot:** Aggregate for registered automation bots.

### Entities

* **IntegrationEvent:** Entity for all state changes and event delivery.
* **Message:** Entity for queued/delivered messages and notifications.

### Value Objects

* **APIKeyId:** Unique identifier for API key and permissions.
* **AdapterConfig:** Immutable adapter configuration.
* **IntegrationStatus:** Enum for integration lifecycle states.

### Domain Events

* **APIKeyCreated:** API key lifecycle initiation.
* **APIKeyRevoked:** Key revocation event.
* **AdapterRegistered:** New adapter added to registry.
* **IntegrationUpgraded:** Upgrade or protocol change detected.
* **MessageDelivered:** Event/message successfully delivered.

### Repository Contracts

* **IAPIKeyRepository:** Track/manage all API keys and their permissions.
* **IAdapterRepository:** Store and manage adapters and their configs.
* **IIntegrationRepository:** Track all integrations and upgrades.
* **IMessageRepository:** Manage all message delivery and event streaming.

### Invariants / Business Rules

* No external call without a valid, permissioned API key.
* Adapter lifecycles must be auditable and upgradeable.
* All integration events must be tracked, signed, and timestamped.
* Bots must be registered, monitored, and version controlled.

## Implementation Strategy: Phased Delivery

### Phase 1 – Foundation & API Perimeter (MVP)

* APIGateway: API key management, authentication, and basic rate limiting.
* AdapterManager: Initial protocol adapter registration and lifecycle management.
* Deliverable: Working MVP with controlled and auditable API access.

### Phase 2 – Integration Orchestration

* IntegrationManager: Orchestrated adapter lifecycles, upgrades, and external protocol coordination.
* MessageBus: Event and notification routing across system and external integrations.
* Deliverable: Automated, extensible protocol orchestration with reliable messaging.

### Phase 3 – Analytics & Automation

* Analytics hooks for external systems, bot management, and full monitoring.
* Deliverable: Advanced analytics integration and full lifecycle management for bots.

### Phase 4 – Production & Advanced State Propagation

* External bot lifecycle, adaptive notification routing, state synchronization with external protocols.
* Deliverable: Complete, production-grade integration ecosystem.
