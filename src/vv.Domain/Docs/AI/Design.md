# 2. Executive Summary

## Business Impact

* Delivers auditable, secure, and compliant AI/ML infrastructure to power DeFi protocols.
* Enables real-time analytics, risk mitigation, and advanced trading features.
* Critical for institutional onboarding, regulatory acceptance, and sustained innovation.

## Technical Impact

* Centralizes model registry, deployment, and version control for all AI/ML models.
* Adds security enforcement (incident, rollback, circuit breaker), bias/fairness controls, and automated compliance monitoring.
* Integrates with protocol governance for operator onboarding and staking.

## Timeline Impact

* Phase 1 MVP: GlobalModelRegistry and SecurityController (model registration, versioning, and incident detection).
* Phase 2: ModelDeploymentController, shadow/canary/prod pipelines, backtesting, and bias/fairness monitoring.
* Phase 3: Governance, operator onboarding, and regulatory reporting.
* Phase 4: OperatorStakingController and full-scale production launch.

# 3. Domain Overview

The AI/ML domain is the intelligence backbone of VeritasVault, responsible for the management, deployment, and governance of all models powering analytics, automation, and optimization. Security, auditability, and regulatory compliance are first-class design goals.

---

# 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

## Core Functions

* Model lifecycle management (registration, update, versioning, promotion)
* Incident detection, rollback, and security policy enforcement
* Bias/fairness monitoring and response
* Operator onboarding, staking, and cartel detection
* Automated regulatory and compliance reporting

## Scope Definition

* **In Scope:**

  * GlobalModelRegistry, SecurityController, ModelDeploymentController, ContinuousFairnessController, GovernanceController (AI), RegulatoryReportingController, OperatorStakingController
* **Out of Scope:**

  * Model implementation specifics, data acquisition logic, user-facing analytics dashboards

---

# 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

## Aggregate Roots

* **ModelMetadata:** Aggregate for all model artifacts, metadata, version, and lifecycle state.
* **IncidentReport:** Aggregate for security incidents, escalation, and rollback records.
* **FairnessConfig:** Aggregate for bias metrics, drift detection, and auto-response.
* **OperatorStake:** Aggregate for operator registration, staking, and cartel prevention.

## Entities

* **ShadowDeployment:** Entity for shadow/canary/prod deployments.
* **BacktestResult:** Entity for backtesting and simulation data.
* **SlashingEvent:** Entity tracking punitive or slashing events for operators.
* **ComplianceReport:** Entity tracking regulatory/attestation events.

## Value Objects

* **ModelIdentifier:** Unique ID/version for models.
* **BiasMetric:** Immutable record of fairness/bias score.
* **DeploymentPhase:** Enum for deployment lifecycle state.

## Domain Events

* **ModelRegistered:** On model onboarding or update.
* **DeploymentStatusChanged:** Promotion between shadow/canary/prod.
* **IncidentReported:** On security event/rollback.
* **FairnessViolation:** Bias/drift violation or automated trigger.
* **OperatorSlashed:** Punitive event for operators.

## Repository Contracts

* **IModelRepository:** Track/manage all model artifacts and versions.
* **IIncidentReportRepository:** Store and retrieve incident reports.
* **IFairnessConfigRepository:** Manage fairness, bias, and drift configs.
* **IOperatorStakeRepository:** Operator records and staking events.
* **IComplianceReportRepository:** Compliance reporting and export.

## Invariants / Business Rules

* No model deployed without passing security and fairness checks.
* All incidents require review and, where relevant, rollback/circuit breaker.
* No operator onboarding without valid stake, regulatory check, and cartel prevention logic.
* All regulatory reports must be cryptographically signed and auditable.

# Implementation Strategy: Phased Delivery

## Phase 1 – Foundation & Model Security (MVP)

* GlobalModelRegistry: Model registration, versioning, and dependency graph
* SecurityController: Incident detection and basic circuit breaker
* Deliverable: Working MVP with secure model onboarding

## Phase 2 – Deployment & Fairness

* ModelDeploymentController: Shadow/canary/production deployment flows, backtesting
* ContinuousFairnessController: Bias and drift monitoring, auto-response triggers
* Deliverable: Production pipeline with automated bias controls

## Phase 3 – Governance & Compliance

* GovernanceController (AI): Operator onboarding, diversity tracking, audit logs
* RegulatoryReportingController: Regulatory reporting and attestation management
* Deliverable: Institutional-grade governance and compliance

## Phase 4 – Operator Staking & Production

* OperatorStakingController: Staking, slashing, cartel prevention
* Deliverable: Fully decentralized, economically secured production deployment
