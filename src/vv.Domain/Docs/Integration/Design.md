# 3. Domain Overview

The Integration, Analytics & Access Domain is the nerve center for all protocol-to-protocol, multi-chain, and off-chain connectivity. It also manages API access, analytics, permissioning, monitoring, and data streaming—making the protocol extensible, auditable, and accessible to internal and external stakeholders. Robust DR, monitoring, and capacity planning are mandatory at every phase.

---

# 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

## Core Functions

* Secure cross-chain bridging and atomic message delivery
* Centralized consensus-driven price oracles
* API perimeter security, rate limiting, and monitoring
* Adapter lifecycle management (integration with external protocols and bots)
* Identity and whitelist management for onboarding and access control
* Analytics streaming, reporting, historical archiving, and advanced analytics pipelines
* Disaster recovery, monitoring, and incident response

## Scope Definition

* **In Scope:**

  * Bridge, MessageBus, PriceOracle, APIGateway, AdapterManager, IntegrationManager, AnalyticsEngine, DataLake, Identity, WhitelistManager, MonitoringSystem, DisasterRecovery
* **Out of Scope:**

  * Direct UI/UX layers, core asset/trading logic, governance/custody internals

# 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

## Aggregate Roots

* **BridgeTransfer:** Core for atomic asset/message transfers and verification across chains.
* **PriceFeed:** Aggregate for consensus oracle data and historical price tracking.
* **APIKey:** Aggregate for API access lifecycle (creation, revocation, monitoring).
* **Identity:** Aggregate for entity registration, permissioning, and whitelist state.
* **AnalyticsPipeline:** Aggregate for advanced analytics stages and data processing.
* **DisasterRecoveryPlan:** Aggregate for incident/DR workflows and checkpoints.

## Entities

* **Adapter:** Entity for external protocol/bot integration.
* **CrossChainMessage:** Entity for message events between chains.
* **AnalyticsMetric:** Entity for all tracked system metrics.
* **DataLakeEntry:** Entity for archiving/querying historical events/data.
* **MonitorEvent:** Entity for system monitoring and alerting.

## Value Objects

* **MessagePayload:** Encapsulates message contents for bridging/queueing.
* **PriceSample:** Immutable point-in-time value from oracle consensus.
* **AccessLevel:** Defines permission scope for API and identity.
* **PipelineStage:** Processing stage for analytics pipeline.
* **RecoveryCheckpoint:** Recovery or rollback snapshot point.

## Domain Events

* **BridgeTransferCompleted:** On atomic cross-chain transfer success.
* **PriceUpdated:** Oracle consensus event, anomaly flagged if required.
* **AdapterRegistered:** Protocol/bot integration event.
* **APIKeyIssued/Revoked:** API access lifecycle events.
* **AccessGranted:** Onboarding or permission elevation.
* **MetricTracked:** When an analytics metric is recorded.
* **DataArchived:** On historical archiving to DataLake.
* **MonitorAlert:** On breach or anomaly detected.
* **RecoveryInitiated/Completed:** Disaster recovery events.

## Repository Contracts

* **IBridgeRepository:** Bridge and message state.
* **IPriceFeedRepository:** Oracle and price data.
* **IAPIKeyRepository:** API keys lifecycle, monitoring.
* **IIdentityRepository:** Identity/whitelist state and permissions.
* **IAnalyticsMetricRepository:** Metrics and streaming data.
* **IDataLakeRepository:** Events/data archives.
* **IMonitoringRepository:** Monitoring events, alert history.
* **IDisasterRecoveryRepository:** DR plans, checkpoints, status.

## Invariants / Business Rules

* All cross-chain transfers must be atomic and verifiable.
* No protocol adapter can be activated without registration, audit, and permissioning.
* All API access is permissioned, rate-limited, and logged.
* Price data must be consensus-driven and anomaly-checked before being published.
* All analytics data is immutable once archived in DataLake.
* DR must provide checkpointing, rollback, and incident simulation.

# 6. Extended Architecture & Interface Patterns

## 1. Repository Architecture

```solidity
interface IRepositoryArchitecture {
    struct RepositoryConfig {
        bytes32 repoId;
        address[] maintainers;
        mapping(bytes32 => bool) features;
        uint256 version;
    }
    function initializeRepo(RepositoryConfig memory config) external;
    function updateFeatures(bytes32[] memory features) external;
    function getRepoStatus(bytes32 repoId) external view returns (bytes memory);
}
```

## 2. Disaster Recovery & Monitoring

```solidity
interface IDisasterRecovery {
    struct RecoveryPlan {
        bytes32 planId;
        uint256 severity;
        bytes32[] steps;
        address[] responders;
    }
    function initiateRecovery(bytes32 planId) external returns (bool);
    function validateRecoveryState() external view returns (bool);
    function rollbackToCheckpoint(bytes32 checkpointId) external;
