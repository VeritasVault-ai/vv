# Implementation Strategy: Phased Delivery

## Phase 1 – Foundation & Architecture

**Objective:** Establish the core technical architecture, domain model, and baseline interfaces.

**Key Activities:**

* Core contract/API design
* Aggregate roots, boundaries, and events defined
* Initial domain entities and value objects implemented
* Design review and stakeholder alignment

**Artifacts / Deliverables:**

* Initial architecture diagrams
* Core interface specifications
* Domain model documentation

---

## Phase 2 – MVP & Testbed

**Objective:** Deliver a minimum viable product with basic working functionality and test scaffolding.

**Key Activities:**

* MVP contract/module deployment
* Integration with test harness
* End-to-end flow exercising all aggregate roots
* Basic operational monitoring and event logging

**Artifacts / Deliverables:**

* MVP deployment record
* Initial test results
* Feedback and improvement log

---

## Phase 3 – Expansion & Robustness

**Objective:** Expand features, address edge cases, and harden operations and security for pre-production.

**Key Activities:**

* Full security and compliance review
* Performance, load, and security testing
* Advanced monitoring, alerting, and runbook preparation
* Extension and plugin points implemented

**Artifacts / Deliverables:**

* Comprehensive test matrices
* Security and compliance audit reports
* Refined system and operational documentation

---

## Phase 4 – LIVE Production Launch

**Objective:** Deploy to production and establish a sustainable, long-term operational cadence.

**Key Activities:**

* Go-live execution plan
* Incident response, monitoring, and maintenance procedures
* Scaling, backup, and disaster recovery
* Post-launch review and continuous improvement cycle

**Artifacts / Deliverables:**

* Go-live checklist
* Finalized runbooks
* Maintenance and review schedule

---

# Operations Guide (Per Phase)

For each phase above, specify:

* Monitoring dashboard metrics
* Alert thresholds
* Incident response playbook
* Maintenance plan (updates, upgrades, backups)

---

# Resource Planning (Per Phase)

Infrastructure, operations, scaling, and cost analysis—clearly split by phase for effective budgeting and resourcing.

---

# Risk & Compliance (Ongoing, Per Phase)

* **Risk Assessment Matrix:** Updated as new threats emerge in each phase.
* **Compliance Requirements:** Mapped to delivery gates and regulatory triggers per phase.

---

# Quality Assurance (Across Phases)

Test requirements, validation gates, and best practices should evolve and accumulate throughout all phases.

---

# Integration Guide

* Explicit dependencies
* API contracts
* How to extend or integrate with other systems

---

# References

* Internal and external documentation
* Relevant standards and templates
* Linked resources

---

# Document Control

* **Owner(s):** Primary / secondary responsible parties
* **Last Reviewed:** Date, reviewer, and summary
* **Change Log:**

  | Version | Date | Author | Changes | Reviewers |
  | ------- | ---- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
* **Review Schedule:** Frequency, next review, and any special triggers

---

# Implementation Guidelines

* Always include explicit aggregate roots and boundaries, entities, value objects, domain events, and invariants in domain documentation.
* Sections may be optional or required per document type; always include Metadata, Executive Summary, and Document Control.
* Use Markdown for version control, YAML for metadata, Mermaid/C4 for diagrams, and tables for matrices.
* Attach a pre-submission checklist and a section requirements matrix.
