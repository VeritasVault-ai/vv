## 2. Overview

This document outlines mandatory guidelines, best practices, and anti-patterns for the VeritasVault Integration Gateway. It addresses API security, adapter management, integration orchestration, monitoring, and operational hygiene to ensure a secure, auditable, and resilient gateway domain.

---

## 3. Core Guidelines

### API Gateway Security

* **Mandatory authentication** (e.g., HMAC/JWT/OAuth2) on all endpoints.
* **Least-privilege** API key issuance: grant only required permissions per key.
* **Per-key and per-resource rate limiting**—avoid global throttling only.
* **Explicit deny by default**—never implicitly allow access.
* **All API calls, webhook events, and admin actions must be logged, versioned, and signed.**
* **API versioning** is required for all external contracts and event payloads.
* **Circuit breakers and request throttling** enforced for every major resource and integration.

### Adapter & Bot Management

* **Sandbox and dependency scan** all third-party adapters/bots before production.
* **Full lifecycle tracking** (registration, upgrades, deactivation, quarantine) for every adapter and bot.
* **No unaudited bot/adapter runs in production.** Quarantine or isolate on failure or anomaly.
* **Strict permission model** for bot activities—track and audit every external call.
* **Automated health monitoring** and metrics for adapters and bots (CPU, memory, errors, calls).

### Integration Orchestration

* **All external event delivery must be auditable, versioned, and encrypted.**
* **Implement replay protection** and idempotency for event/message delivery.
* **Message queues require prioritization, dead-letter, and replay defense.**
* **Webhooks/event endpoints must enforce authentication, versioning, and payload integrity checks.**

### Monitoring & Observability

* **Real-time monitoring** on API calls, adapter state, integration health, and event queues.
* **Automated alerts** on key revocation, rate breaches, quarantine triggers, and failed deliveries.
* **Audit dashboards** for tracking all API, adapter, and integration activity.

### Upgrade, Rollback & Automation

* **All adapters and integrations must support rollback and upgrade.**
* **Automate dependency scanning, sandboxing, and security audits as part of CI/CD.**
* **Self-healing and automated quarantine/remediation for failed adapters/integrations.**
* **Automated integration testing (mock protocols, cross-chain, bot behaviors) before deploy.**

---

## 4. Advanced Best Practices

* **Zero trust:** Never trust external payloads, adapters, or bots—validate, scan, and verify everything.
* **Explicit API contract:** Document all endpoints, permissions, and versioning. Maintain backward compatibility.
* **Integration extensibility:** Design for plug-in protocols, adapters, and event formats.
* **Encrypted event streaming:** End-to-end encryption on all external message flows.
* **Performance benchmarking:** Monitor and tune for throughput, latency, and queue depth per integration.
* **Cost awareness:** Track and optimize event/message delivery costs, especially for high-frequency APIs.
* **Resilience drills:** Regularly test failover, replay, rollback, and quarantine procedures.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Remediation

| Pitfall                       | Consequence                          | How to Avoid/Fix                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Global, unbounded rate limits | DoS and resource starvation          | Use per-key, per-resource limits   |
| No circuit breaker            | System-wide failure on overload      | Implement circuit breakers         |
| Missing replay/idempotency    | Double-execution, race attacks       | Enforce replay protection          |
| Adapter dependency sprawl     | Security and supply chain risk       | Mandatory dependency scanning      |
| Implicit allow in permissions | Unauthorized access/escalation       | Prefer explicit deny, strict audit |
| No adapter sandboxing         | Production compromise risk           | Sandbox/isolate all integrations   |
| Bot activity untracked        | Resource exhaustion, abuse/exploit   | Monitor/audit all bots             |
| Unversioned webhooks          | Upgrade breakage, data loss          | Version all webhooks and payloads  |
| No encrypted event streaming  | Data leak/interception               | End-to-end encryption everywhere   |
| Poor integration rollback     | Extended downtime, unrecoverable err | Rollback as a required capability  |

## 6. Implementation Considerations

* **API contracts and adapters must be testable independently.**
* **All resource usage and error metrics must be observable in real time.**
* **Operational runbooks must exist for all major failure scenarios (rate breach, circuit breaker, adapter quarantine, etc.).**
* **Compliance with regulatory standards (GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001) is non-negotiable for external integrations.**
* **Cross-chain adapters must validate source/target integrity and support message proofing.**
* **Message bus must support prioritization, replay, and encryption out of the box.**
* **Continuous integration must enforce all security, audit, and compliance gates.**
