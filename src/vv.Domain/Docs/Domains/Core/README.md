## Purpose

The Core Infrastructure layer provides the foundational security, consensus, and operational guarantees required by all higher-level modules. It handles blockchain integration, protocol security, financial data storage, and computational resource management.

Each component has been designed for:

* **Composability**: All modules can be tested and audited independently
* **Security**: Comprehensive threat modeling and mitigation strategies
* **Scalability**: Ability to handle growing volumes of transactions and data
* **Interoperability**: Cross-chain compatibility through abstraction layers
* **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

Refer to the individual documents for detailed specifications of each component.
