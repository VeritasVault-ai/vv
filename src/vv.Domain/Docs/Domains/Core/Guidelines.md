# VeritasVault Core Infrastructure

## Guidelines, Best Practices, Considerations & Common Pitfalls

---

## 1. Architectural Guidelines

* **Event Sourcing First:** All state transitions, block finalizations, and protocol actions must emit cryptographically signed events. Any mutation not event-logged is invalid.
* **Replayability & Rollback:** All events and state must be strictly replayable from genesis; rollback drills are mandatory before and after upgrades.
* **Circuit Breaker Everywhere:** Every critical module must support circuit-breaker logic—automatic anomaly detection and safe pause/resume paths.
* **Zero Trust/No Silent Mutations:** No trust in off-chain or side-channel changes. If a state change isn't event-sourced, it's not valid.
* **Modular, Upgradeable, Versioned:** All interfaces, contracts, and event schemas must be versioned. Modules must be independently upgradeable and auditable.
* **Multi-Chain Abstracted:** All L1/L2/sidechain dependencies must be adapter-based—no hardcoded chain logic.
* **Incident Response as Protocol:** Incident detection, drill, and recovery flows are required for every module, not an afterthought.

## 2. Best Practices Checklist

1. **Explicit Finality**

   * Always check for block finality before updating state.
   * One and only one finalized block per height.
2. **Deterministic Indexing**

   * Index all events in global order; ensure no event gaps or reordering.
3. **Verifiable Randomness**

   * Only accept VRF proofs with public, multi-source verification.
   * No reliance on single or opaque entropy sources.
4. **Gas & Economic Controls**

   * Automated detection of gas pricing anomalies and transaction spam.
   * On-demand and circuit-breaker controlled fee market adjustments.
5. **Defense-in-Depth**

   * All emergency/security/abuse controls must be testable and triggerable independently.
   * No single point of failure in access or pause/resume control.
6. **Multi-Chain/Fork Ready**

   * Adapter patterns everywhere. Cross-chain compatibility is not optional.
   * Fork/split detection, snapshots, and replay for all critical flows.
7. **Monitoring & Alerting**

   * Mandatory monitoring of consensus health, event log growth, anomaly events, and critical gas/pause triggers.
   * Alerts must cover both liveness and safety issues.
8. **Auditability**

   * Every material state transition is logged, hash-proven, and replayable.
   * Audit logs must be independently verifiable and stored with redundancy.
9. **Testing & Release Gates**

   * No module may be promoted to prod without full replay, rollback, and circuit breaker test coverage.
   * All upgrades require pre/post incident drill.
10. **Documentation Discipline**

    * All modules, contracts, and interface changes must be reflected in both doc and version history.

## 3. Key Considerations

* **Cross-Module Consistency:** Ensure event sourcing, versioning, and replay logic are consistent across modules—mismatches are a root cause of historic blockchain bugs.
* **Gas/Economic Attack Surface:** Dynamic fee logic must be stress-tested for edge cases; static policies are a DoS vector.
* **Incident Drill Frequency:** Rollback and circuit breaker drills aren’t ceremonial—test after every upgrade and on a schedule.
* **Chain Splits and Reorgs:** Never assume canonical history. Always check, snapshot, and be ready to revert on reorg or fork.
* **Interface Stability:** Avoid breaking changes; use deprecation/version bump policy and adapters for new logic.
* **Validator Liveness:** Redundancy is non-optional. Any validator downtime must not block core protocol liveness or safety.
* **External Integration:** All oracle, bridge, and off-chain integrations must have their own event sourcing and audit, not just on-chain record.

## 4. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

* **Silent State Mutations:** If a mutation isn’t event-logged, it will cause audit/rollback failure. Make this an auto-failing test in CI.
* **Non-Replayable Upgrades:** Skipping replay/rollback drills after upgrades often results in unfixable liveness or audit failures in prod.
* **Ad Hoc Circuit Breakers:** Hardcoded or ad hoc pause logic leads to stuck chains or bypassed security. Always implement modular, testable circuit breakers.
* **Single-Source Randomness:** Using only one VRF or entropy source makes you a sitting duck for manipulation. Always aggregate sources and proofs.
* **Complacency on Cross-Chain:** Hardcoding assumptions for one L1/L2 kills future migration and upgrade flexibility—always abstract.
* **Poor Documentation Discipline:** Untracked interface or contract changes make forensic audit and rollback impossible. Enforce doc/version hygiene in process.
* **Insufficient Monitoring:** No alerts = slow detection of catastrophic failures. Mandate on-call and automated monitoring for every critical metric.
