# Authentication Mechanisms

> Supported Authentication Methods in VeritasVault

---

## Overview

This document details the authentication mechanisms supported by the VeritasVault Authentication Framework. It describes each method's implementation, security characteristics, and appropriate use cases.

## Primary Authentication Methods

### Username and Password

#### Implementation Details

* Secure password storage using Argon2id with appropriate parameters
* Password complexity requirements with zxcvbn strength estimation
* Account lockout after failed attempts with exponential backoff
* Password rotation policies for regulatory compliance
* Password breach detection via haveibeenpwned integration

#### Security Considerations

* Resistance to offline attacks through proper hashing
* Protection against credential stuffing
* Mitigation of brute force attacks through rate limiting
* Secure credential reset workflows
* Password strength feedback during creation

#### Appropriate Use Cases

* Basic authentication for low to medium risk operations
* Initial authentication factor before step-up
* Legacy system integration where required
* Fallback authentication when other methods unavailable

### Multi-Factor Authentication

#### TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password)

* RFC 6238 compliant implementation
* Support for standard authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
* QR code and manual entry provisioning
* Backup code generation for recovery
* Device management for multiple authenticators

#### Push Notification Authentication

* Mobile app integration for one-tap approval
* Rich context display (location, device, application)
* Cryptographic verification of request authenticity
* Timeout for unacknowledged requests
* Support for approval with biometric verification

#### SMS/Email One-Time Codes

* Secure code generation with appropriate entropy
* Limited validity period (5-10 minutes)
* Rate limiting of code generation
* Protection against enumeration attacks
* Secure transmission channels

#### Hardware Security Keys

* FIDO2/WebAuthn support for hardware key integration
* U2F support for backward compatibility
* Multiple key registration for redundancy
* Touch/presence verification requirement
* Phishing-resistant authentication

### Passwordless Authentication

#### Magic Links

* One-time use authentication links
* Limited validity period (15 minutes)
* Device context binding
* Secure delivery via email
* Protection against interception

#### Biometric Authentication

* FIDO2 biometric implementation
* Local biometric verification only (no biometric data transmission)
* Secure enclave integration where available
* Fallback mechanisms for accessibility
* Liveness detection where supported

#### Certificate-Based Authentication

* X.509 certificate authentication
* Client certificate validation
* Certificate revocation checking
* Certificate lifecycle management
* Hardware-based certificate storage support

## Contextual Authentication

### Risk-Based Authentication

* Dynamic authentication requirements based on risk factors:
  * Location anomalies
  * Device characteristics
  * Behavioral patterns
  * Access patterns
  * Resource sensitivity
* Progressive authentication with step-up as needed
* Risk score calculation algorithm
* Configurable risk thresholds
* Transparent vs. challenged authentication decisions

### Continuous Authentication

* Passive session validation based on:
  * Behavioral biometrics (typing patterns, mouse movements)
  * Session characteristics
  * Activity patterns
  * Environmental factors
* Confidence score maintenance throughout session
* Step-up triggers when confidence falls below thresholds
* API for applications to check authentication confidence
* Privacy-preserving implementation

## Enterprise Authentication

### SAML 2.0

* Full SAML 2.0 specification support
* IdP-initiated and SP-initiated flows
* Attribute mapping configuration
* Certificate management for signing and encryption
* Federation metadata management

### OpenID Connect

* OpenID Connect Core 1.0 implementation
* Support for all standard flows:
  * Authorization Code
  * Implicit (for legacy support only)
  * Hybrid
* JWT signature validation
* Discovery endpoint support
* UserInfo endpoint implementation

### WS-Federation

* WS-Federation protocol support for enterprise integration
* Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) compatibility
* Claims transformation
* Home Realm Discovery
* Integrated Windows Authentication support

## Machine-to-Machine Authentication

### Client Credentials

* OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow
* Strong client secret requirements
* Client certificate authentication option
* Fine-grained scope control
* Rate limiting based on client identity

### API Keys

* Cryptographically strong key generation
* Key rotation mechanisms
* Usage-specific keys with limited scopes
* Activity monitoring for anomaly detection
* Automated revocation for suspicious activity

### Mutual TLS

* Client and server certificate validation
* Certificate pinning options
* Certificate chain validation
* Strong cipher suite requirements
* Certificate renewal monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Authentication Method Selection

* Select authentication methods based on:
  * Risk profile of protected resources
  * User experience requirements
  * Compliance mandates
  * Platform capabilities
  * Accessibility needs

* Default authentication strength requirements:
  * Public information: Single factor
  * Personal information: Two factors
  * Financial transactions: Two factors with one strong factor
  * Administrative access: Two strong factors

### Authentication UX Best Practices

* Minimize friction for appropriate security level
* Clear error messages without information leakage
* Seamless step-up authentication when required
* Consistent experience across authentication methods
* Accessibility compliance for all authentication interfaces

### Security Monitoring

* Comprehensive logging of authentication events
* Anomaly detection for authentication patterns
* Real-time alerting for suspicious activities
* Authentication success/failure rate monitoring
* Regular security review of authentication logs
