# Identity Services

> User Identity Management in the VeritasVault Platform

---

## Overview

This document details the Identity Services component of the VeritasVault Authentication Framework, which is responsible for managing user identities, profiles, and credentials throughout their lifecycle.

## Core Capabilities

### Identity Lifecycle Management

* **User Provisioning**: Creation of new user identities
* **Identity Updates**: Modification of identity attributes
* **Account Suspension**: Temporary access restriction
* **Account Deactivation**: Long-term access restriction
* **Account Termination**: Complete removal of access
* **Identity Restoration**: Recovery of deactivated accounts
* **Dormant Account Management**: Handling inactive identities

### Profile Management

* **Core Profile Attributes**: Essential user information
* **Extended Attributes**: Role-specific data elements
* **Preference Management**: User settings and preferences
* **Contact Information**: Communication channels
* **Profile Visibility Controls**: Privacy settings
* **Profile Verification**: Validation of critical attributes
* **Profile Completeness**: Progressive profile enhancement

### Credential Management

* **Credential Storage**: Secure handling of authentication factors
* **Credential Reset**: Self-service and administrative reset
* **Credential Recovery**: Lost credential restoration
* **Credential Rotation**: Periodic refresh requirements
* **Compromised Credential Detection**: Breach monitoring
* **Multi-Factor Enrollment**: Secondary factor registration
* **Device Management**: Trusted device registration

## System Architecture

### Identity Data Model

#### Core Identity Object

```json
{
  "id": "user-uuid-value",
  "username": "jsmith",
  "email": "john.smith@example.com",
  "status": "active",
  "created": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "lastModified": "2025-05-20T09:15:42Z",
  "lastAuthenticated": "2025-05-29T08:23:15Z",
  "type": "individual",
  "verificationStatus": "verified",
  "profile": {
    // Profile attributes
  },
  "credentials": {
    // Credential references
  },
  "mfaSettings": {
    // Multi-factor settings
  },
  "groups": [
    // Group memberships
  ],
  "roles": [
    // Assigned roles
  ],
  "permissions": {
    // Direct permissions
  },
  "metadata": {
    // System metadata
  }
}
```

#### Profile Schema

Flexible schema supporting:
* Standard attributes common to all users
* Role-specific attributes
* Tenant-specific attributes
* Extensible attribute framework

#### Schema Management

* Centralized schema definition
* Schema versioning
* Attribute validation rules
* Required vs. optional attributes
* Data type enforcement

### Service Components

#### Identity Directory Service

* Scalable identity repository
* High-performance query capabilities
* Hierarchical organization support
* Fine-grained access controls
* Audit trail of identity changes

#### Profile Service

* Profile CRUD operations
* Attribute validation
* Profile search functionality
* Batch profile operations
* Profile import/export capabilities

#### Credential Service

* Credential storage and management
* Password policy enforcement
* Credential health monitoring
* Credential history tracking
* Secure credential reset workflows

#### Self-Service Portal

* User-driven profile management
* Credential self-service
* MFA enrollment
* Privacy settings management
* Account recovery processes

## Data Storage and Security

### Identity Data Classification

* **Public Identity Data**: Non-sensitive attributes
* **Protected Identity Data**: Personally identifiable information
* **Sensitive Identity Data**: High-value attributes
* **Credential Data**: Authentication secrets

### Storage Security

* Data encryption at rest
* Field-level encryption for sensitive attributes
* Secure key management
* Data integrity validation
* Secure backup and recovery

### Access Controls

* Role-based access to identity data
* Attribute-level access restrictions
* Administrative action approval workflows
* Privileged access management
* Just-in-time administrative access

### Privacy Controls

* Data minimization practices
* Purpose-specific data collection
* Retention period enforcement
* Data anonymization capabilities
* Right to be forgotten implementation

## Identity Workflows

### User Registration

1. Capture minimal identity information
2. Validate email/phone ownership
3. Create initial identity record
4. Establish initial credentials
5. Progressive profile completion
6. Role/group assignment

### Account Recovery

1. Identity verification through secondary channels
2. Risk-based recovery requirements
3. Step-up verification for sensitive accounts
4. Time-limited recovery tokens
5. Notification of recovery attempts
6. Audit trail of recovery actions

### Profile Verification

1. Attribute verification requests
2. Documentation collection
3. Verification process tracking
4. Manual review workflow
5. Verification status updates
6. Re-verification scheduling

### Account Closure

1. Closure request initiation
2. Data export option
3. Service disconnection
4. Retention period notification
5. Soft deletion implementation
6. Eventual hard deletion with data anonymization

## Administrative Capabilities

### Identity Administration

* User search and filtering
* Bulk identity operations
* Administrative account recovery
* Forced password reset
* Account status management
* Administrative notifications

### Organizational Management

* Organizational hierarchy definition
* Group creation and management
* Role definition and assignment
* Identity relationships
* Administrative delegation

### Compliance Support

* Identity attestation workflows
* Access certification processes
* Regulatory reporting
* Audit log generation
* Evidence collection for compliance

### Analytics and Reporting

* Identity usage patterns
* Authentication success/failure metrics
* Self-service effectiveness
* Administrative action tracking
* Compliance report generation

## Integration Points

### Internal System Integration

* Core services identity consumption
* Attribute sharing with internal systems
* Event-based integration patterns
* Identity synchronization services
* Delegated authentication

### External Integration

* Customer identity federation
* Enterprise directory synchronization
* HR system integration
* External validation services
* Third-party identity verification

## Scalability and Performance

### Performance Targets

* User profile retrieval: <50ms (95th percentile)
* Identity creation: <500ms (95th percentile)
* Identity updates: <200ms (95th percentile)
* Directory search: <500ms (95th percentile)
* Authentication verification: <100ms (95th percentile)

### Scaling Approach

* Horizontal scaling of identity services
* Read replicas for high-query load
* Caching strategy for frequent lookups
* Database sharding for large user populations
* Geographic distribution for global deployments
