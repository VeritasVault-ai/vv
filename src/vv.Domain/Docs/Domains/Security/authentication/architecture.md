# Authentication Architecture

> Architectural Design of the VeritasVault Authentication System

---

## Overview

This document details the architectural design of the Authentication Framework within the VeritasVault platform. It defines the structure, components, patterns, and interactions that provide secure, scalable, and flexible authentication capabilities.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

* Distinct separation between authentication and authorization
* Modular components with clear responsibilities
* Loose coupling between authentication services
* Clear boundaries between authentication domains

### 2. Security by Design

* Zero trust architecture approach
* Defense in depth through layered security
* Principle of least privilege
* Secure by default configuration

### 3. Scalability and Resilience

* Horizontally scalable authentication services
* No single points of failure
* Graceful degradation under load
* Geographic distribution for performance and compliance

### 4. Extensibility

* Pluggable authentication mechanism support
* Adaptable to new security requirements
* Configurable without code changes
* Support for multiple concurrent authentication methods

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

![Authentication Architecture Diagram](../assets/authentication-architecture.png)

The Authentication Framework is structured as a set of specialized microservices working together to provide comprehensive authentication functionality:

### Core Services

#### Identity Provider Service

* **Responsibility**: Central authentication service
* **Functions**:
  * Credential verification
  * Multi-factor authentication orchestration
  * Token issuance
  * Session management
  * Authentication policy enforcement

#### Identity Management Service

* **Responsibility**: User identity data management
* **Functions**:
  * User profile storage and retrieval
  * Credential management
  * Account lifecycle management
  * Self-service identity operations
  * Identity data validation

#### Token Service

* **Responsibility**: Authentication token lifecycle management
* **Functions**:
  * Access token issuance
  * Refresh token management
  * Token validation
  * Token revocation
  * Token introspection

#### Directory Service

* **Responsibility**: User and group directory
* **Functions**:
  * User record management
  * Group membership
  * Organizational structure
  * Directory synchronization
  * Attribute management

### Supporting Services

#### Multi-Factor Authentication Service

* **Responsibility**: Second-factor authentication
* **Functions**:
  * Time-based one-time password (TOTP)
  * Push notifications
  * SMS verification codes
  * Email verification codes
  * Hardware token integration

#### Risk Assessment Service

* **Responsibility**: Authentication risk evaluation
* **Functions**:
  * Login attempt analysis
  * Behavioral pattern recognition
  * Anomaly detection
  * Geographic analysis
  * Device fingerprinting

#### Audit Service

* **Responsibility**: Authentication event logging
* **Functions**:
  * Comprehensive event capture
  * Tamper-evident logging
  * Log storage and retention
  * Log search and retrieval
  * Compliance reporting

#### Integration Service

* **Responsibility**: External identity provider integration
* **Functions**:
  * Federation with enterprise IdPs
  * Social login integration
  * Protocol translation
  * Attribute mapping
  * Just-in-time provisioning

## Authentication Data Flow

### Registration Flow

1. User initiates account creation
2. Identity Management Service validates registration data
3. Directory Service creates user record
4. Identity Management Service stores credentials (hashed)
5. Optional MFA enrollment via MFA Service
6. Audit Service logs registration events

### Authentication Flow

1. User initiates login with credentials
2. Identity Provider Service receives authentication request
3. Identity Management Service verifies credentials
4. Risk Assessment Service evaluates authentication risk
5. MFA Service triggers second factor if required
6. Token Service issues tokens upon successful authentication
7. Session established for the authenticated user
8. Audit Service logs authentication events

### Token Refresh Flow

1. Client presents refresh token to Token Service
2. Token Service validates refresh token
3. Risk Assessment Service evaluates refresh context
4. Token Service issues new access token
5. Token Service optionally rotates refresh token
6. Audit Service logs token refresh event

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization

* All authentication services deployed as containers
* Kubernetes orchestration for scaling and resilience
* Service mesh for secure service-to-service communication
* Configuration management through ConfigMaps and Secrets

### Multi-Region Deployment

* Geographically distributed authentication services
* Data residency compliance through regional deployment
* Active-active configuration for resilience
* Global load balancing for optimal routing

### High Availability Design

* Minimum of three instances per service
* Multi-zone deployment within regions
* Database replication with automated failover
* Redundant network paths

## Security Considerations

### Credential Security

* Password hashing using Argon2id
* Secure key management system for cryptographic keys
* Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
* Credential breach detection

### Communication Security

* TLS 1.3 for all communications
* Certificate-based service authentication
* Mutual TLS between services
* API gateway with request validation

### Data Protection

* Encryption of authentication data at rest
* Tokenization of sensitive identity attributes
* Minimal collection of personal data
* Data lifecycle management

### Operational Security

* Secure CI/CD pipeline for deployment
* Vulnerability scanning of authentication services
* Penetration testing regime
* Security monitoring and alerting

## Evolution Strategy

### Near-Term Enhancements

* FIDO2/WebAuthn integration
* Risk-based authentication improvements
* Enterprise federation enhancements
* Performance optimizations

### Long-Term Vision

* Continuous authentication capabilities
* Advanced behavioral biometrics
* Zero-knowledge proof authentication
* Decentralized identity support
