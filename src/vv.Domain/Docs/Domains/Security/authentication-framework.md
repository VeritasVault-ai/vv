# Authentication Framework

> Secure Identity and Access Management Architecture

---

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the VeritasVault Authentication Framework, the system responsible for securely verifying user identities and managing access credentials across all platform interfaces. The detailed aspects of the framework are covered in specialized documents linked below.

## Framework Components

The Authentication Framework consists of several interconnected components, each documented in detail:

* [Authentication Architecture](./authentication/architecture.md): Describes the overall architectural design, patterns, and principles
* [Authentication Mechanisms](./authentication/mechanisms.md): Details the supported authentication methods and protocols
* [Identity Services](./authentication/identity-services.md): Covers user identity management and storage
* [Token Management](./authentication/token-management.md): Explains the token lifecycle and management
* [Integration Points](./authentication/integration.md): Describes integration with external identity providers and systems

## Core Principles

The VeritasVault Authentication Framework adheres to these fundamental principles:

### 1. Defense in Depth

* Multiple layers of security controls
* No single point of authentication failure
* Layered verification for high-risk operations
* Comprehensive monitoring across authentication layers

### 2. User-Centric Identity

* User control over identity information
* Self-service credential management
* Privacy by design
* Transparent authentication processes

### 3. Adaptive Security

* Risk-based authentication challenges
* Context-aware security controls
* Behavioral analytics integration
* Progressive security measures

### 4. Standards Compliance

* Implementation of industry authentication standards
* Regular security assessment against benchmarks
* Regulatory compliance built into the framework
* Future-proof design for evolving standards

## Authentication Flow

The standard authentication flow follows these steps:

1. **Identity Claim**: User presents identity credentials
2. **Verification**: System validates credentials against stored values
3. **Risk Assessment**: Context and behavior are evaluated for risk signals
4. **Challenge Decision**: Additional verification steps if risk threshold exceeded
5. **Token Issuance**: Authentication tokens issued upon successful verification
6. **Session Establishment**: User session created with appropriate permissions
7. **Continuous Validation**: Ongoing session monitoring and re-verification

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation

* Core credential authentication
* Basic session management
* Initial role-based authorization
* Essential logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security

* Multi-factor authentication
* Risk-based authentication
* Advanced session management
* Enhanced monitoring and analytics

### Phase 3: Enterprise Integration

* Enterprise identity provider integration
* Advanced delegation and federation
* Cross-organization authentication
* Privileged access management

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

* Passwordless authentication options
* Biometric integration
* Behavioral analytics
* Continuous authentication
