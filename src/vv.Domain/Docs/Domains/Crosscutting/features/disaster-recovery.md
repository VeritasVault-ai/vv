## Implementation Guidelines

### Backup Strategy

* Implement a multi-tier backup approach with different retention periods
* Ensure backups are encrypted both in transit and at rest
* Test restores regularly, not just backup creation
* Document backup dependencies and relationships
* Maintain backup diversity (different methods and locations)

### Recovery Planning

* Create clear, step-by-step recovery procedures for different scenarios
* Assign specific roles and responsibilities for recovery operations
* Establish communication protocols for recovery situations
* Maintain current system documentation to support recovery
* Practice recovery procedures regularly with different team members

### Failover Design

* Design systems for resilience from the beginning
* Implement automated health checks and monitoring
* Create graduated response mechanisms based on failure severity
* Test failover regularly under realistic conditions
* Document fallback procedures for all automated processes

### Testing Approach

* Schedule regular recovery testing
* Vary test scenarios to cover different failure modes
* Include surprise elements in some tests
* Document and track test results and improvements
* Involve all relevant teams in recovery exercises

### Documentation Requirements

* Maintain current recovery playbooks
* Document system dependencies and recovery order
* Keep configuration information up to date
* Record test results and lessons learned
* Update procedures based on actual recovery experiences
