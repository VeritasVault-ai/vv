# VeritasVault Risk & Compliance

> Risk Management, Compliance, and Audit Systems

## 1. Overview

Defines the risk, compliance, and audit pillar of VeritasVault. The system is engineered for real-time, multi-factor risk management, robust regulatory alignment, and cryptographically auditable controls. All data and operations are designed for zero trust, rapid response, and external proof—no hand-waving, no black boxes.

## 2. Domain Model & Responsibilities

### A. Risk & Compliance Domain

#### 1. RiskModel

**Purpose**: Centralized risk engine for real-time, predictive, and scheduled analysis.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Calculate, aggregate, and store multi-factor risk metrics and scores
* Support composite and cross-domain risk assessment workflows
* Enforce and version up-to-date, parameterized risk policies
* Maintain, validate, and audit all deployed risk models and policy versions
* Integrate ML-based anomaly detection and predictive stress testing

```solidity
interface IEnhancedRiskAssessment {
    struct CompositeRisk {
        bytes32 assessmentId;
        uint256[] riskScores;
        bytes32[] riskFactors;
        mapping(bytes32 => bytes) evidence;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
    function assessCompositeRisk(bytes32 targetId) external returns (CompositeRisk memory);
    function validateRiskFactors(bytes32[] memory factors) external view returns (bool);
    function getRiskMetrics(bytes32 assessmentId) external view returns (bytes memory);
}
```

#### 2. RealTimeMonitor

**Purpose**: Proactive, system-wide monitoring and alerting.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Configure and run real-time monitoring for all risk and compliance KPIs
* Trigger alerts and automated responses on threshold breaches
* Maintain alert history and incident logs for audit and review

```solidity
interface IRealTimeMonitor {
    struct MonitorConfig {
        bytes32 monitorId;
        uint256 updateInterval;
        bytes32[] metrics;
        address[] alertReceivers;
    }
    function configureMonitor(MonitorConfig memory config) external;
    function checkThresholds() external view returns (bytes32[] memory);
    function getAlertHistory(uint256 timeframe) external view returns (bytes[] memory);
}
```

#### 3. ComplianceManager

**Purpose**: Automated regulatory compliance engine and reporting system.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Generate, schedule, and automate all compliance/attestation reports
* Maintain full, exportable audit trails for every regulated activity
* Enforce regulatory, KYC/AML, and internal rule engines (configurable, versioned)
* Integrate templates for regulatory reporting and real-time status
* Support zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain-based audit export

```solidity
interface IComplianceReporting {
    struct ReportTemplate {
        bytes32 templateId;
        bytes32[] requiredFields;
        bytes32[] optionalFields;
        bytes32 format;
    }
    function generateReport(bytes32 templateId) external returns (bytes memory);
    function validateReport(bytes32 reportId) external view returns (bool);
    function getReportHistory(bytes32 entityId) external view returns (bytes32[] memory);
}
```

#### 4. AuditLogger

**Purpose**: Immutable, cryptographic audit log, proof, and regulatory attestation system.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Append-only, blockchain-based or hash-chained event logs (all critical operations)
* Generate signed, verifiable attestations for every audit event
* Provide cryptographically verifiable proofs to regulators and third parties
* Archive, retain, and export historical data in tamper-proof formats
* Support zero-knowledge and privacy-preserving audit exports

```solidity
interface IAuditLogger {
    function logEvent(
        bytes32 eventType,
        bytes calldata data,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external returns (bytes32);
    function verifyAuditTrail(bytes32 eventId) external view returns (bool);
    function getAuditProof(bytes32 eventId) external view returns (bytes memory);
}
```

## 3. Implementation Patterns & Critical Success Factors

* **Multi-Factor Risk Modeling:** All risk assessments must use pluggable, multi-factor analysis—never a single metric.
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Every risk model, compliance status, and audit event is monitored live; automated alerts and incident triggers are mandatory.
* **Automated, Regulatory-Grade Reporting:** All reports are template-driven, versioned, and exportable in formats required by global regulators.
* **Cryptographically Immutable Audit:** All logs and reports are append-only, blockchain-anchored (where feasible), and support privacy-preserving proofs (e.g., zk-proofs).
* **Performance Metrics:** Define SLAs and dashboards for risk assessment latency, report generation time, data integrity checks, and incident response.

## 4. Compliance & Audit Requirements

### Regulatory Reporting

* Daily position/exposure reports
* Automated transaction and anomaly monitoring
* Continuous risk exposure and compliance analysis
* Formal attestations—scheduled and ad-hoc

### Audit Procedures

* Real-time logging of all critical, regulated, or privileged actions
* Cryptographic hash/signature verification for all logs
* Tamper-proof, append-only retention (no deletes/overwrites)
* Full access controls and context on every audit record
* Exportable proofs (PDF, JSON, XBRL, zk-Proof)

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Risk Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)

## 6. Security & Threat Considerations

| Threat Type             | Vector/Scenario                  | Mitigation/Control                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk Model Evasion      | Manual overrides, hidden flows   | Immutable logs, multi-sig attestations, RT alerts        |
| Audit Tampering         | Log manipulation, silent edit    | Blockchain/hash chain, cryptographic proofs, access logs |
| Compliance Gaps         | Out-of-date rules, missed events | Versioned rules, automated triggers, alerting            |
| Data Retention Failure  | Silent deletes, selective loss   | Tamper-proof storage, scheduled audits                   |
| Regulatory Blacklisting | Report inaccuracies, delay       | Real-time, automated reporting, exportable proofs        |

## 7. Best Practices

1. **Multi-Dimensional Factorization:** All risk/compliance analysis is multi-factor, pluggable, and validated per deployment.
2. **Immutable Audit Trails:** No mutable logs—append-only, signed, and (if possible) blockchain-anchored.
3. **Automated, Versioned Compliance:** All rules, policies, and templates are version-controlled and logged for full traceability.
4. **Real-Time, Predictive Monitoring:** Live dashboards and ML-based alerting for every critical threshold; alerts must trigger documented incident responses.
5. **Privacy and Regulatory Proofs:** Support zero-knowledge proofs and multiple export formats; no manual or unverifiable attestation.
6. **SLAs and Monitoring:** Enforce SLAs for every critical system, with dashboards and escalation for persistent breaches.

## 8. Integration & Composition

* Full API documentation for integration with all core infra, analytics, and external systems
* Modular extension for risk factors, compliance rules, and report formats
* Incident and audit logs directly consumable by regulators, security teams, and compliance officers

*In VeritasVault, "provable compliance" isn’t marketing—it’s an existential requirement. Build to withstand the harshest audit, assume adversarial review, and log every decision. If you can’t prove it cryptographically, assume it never happened.*
