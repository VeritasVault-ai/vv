# API Performance Standards

> Guidelines for Building High-Performance APIs

---

## Overview

This document outlines the performance standards for all APIs within the VeritasVault platform. These standards ensure APIs are responsive, scalable, and efficient under various load conditions.

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets

* **Critical Path APIs**: 95th percentile < 200ms
* **Standard APIs**: 95th percentile < 500ms
* **Analytics/Reporting APIs**: 95th percentile < 2000ms
* **Batch Processing APIs**: Appropriate for data volume (documented SLAs)

### Availability Targets

* **Core APIs**: 99.99% uptime (< 1 hour downtime per year)
* **Standard APIs**: 99.9% uptime (< 9 hours downtime per year)
* **Non-critical APIs**: 99.5% uptime (< 44 hours downtime per year)

### Throughput Requirements

* All APIs must support horizontal scaling
* Document throughput capabilities and limits for each endpoint
* Support for burst traffic (2-3x average load)
* Degradation should be graceful under extreme load

## Optimization Techniques

### Caching Strategy

* **Response Caching**
  * Implement HTTP caching using ETag and Cache-Control headers
  * Document caching behavior for each endpoint
  * Use appropriate cache durations based on data volatility
  * Implement conditional requests (If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since)

* **Application Caching**
  * Cache frequently accessed resources
  * Implement distributed caching for multi-instance deployments
  * Use cache invalidation based on data changes
  * Monitor cache hit/miss rates

### Database Optimization

* Design efficient queries optimized for API access patterns
* Use appropriate indexes for frequent query patterns
* Implement database connection pooling
* Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads
* Use database query caching where appropriate
* Optimize join operations and limit query complexity
* Use paging for large data sets

### Payload Optimization

* Minimize response payload size
* Support field selection to return only required fields
* Use compression (gzip/deflate) for all responses
* Implement streaming for large payloads
* Use appropriate data types to minimize serialization overhead
* Optimize embedded media (images, documents)

### Asynchronous Processing

* Use asynchronous processing for time-intensive operations
* Implement webhook callbacks for long-running processes
* Provide status endpoints for tracking asynchronous operations
* Use message queues for distributed processing
* Document expected processing times for asynchronous operations

## Performance Testing Requirements

### Load Testing

* Conduct load tests before each major release
* Test normal load (average traffic)
* Test peak load (2-3x average traffic)
* Test sustained load (constant high traffic)
* Document performance degradation patterns

### Stress Testing

* Test API behavior at breaking points
* Identify failure modes and recovery patterns
* Test auto-scaling capabilities
* Measure recovery time after overload

### Endurance Testing

* Test performance stability over extended periods (24+ hours)
* Monitor for memory leaks and resource consumption
* Verify consistent performance over time
* Test with realistic traffic patterns

### Performance Monitoring

* Implement real-time performance monitoring
* Track response times, error rates, and throughput
* Set up alerts for performance degradation
* Create performance dashboards for visibility
* Conduct regular performance reviews

## Implementation Guidance

### Connection Management

* Use HTTP/2 where possible to reduce connection overhead
* Implement connection pooling for backend services
* Configure appropriate timeouts for all connections
* Use keep-alive connections where appropriate
* Monitor connection usage and errors

### Concurrency Control

* Design APIs to handle concurrent requests
* Implement appropriate locking mechanisms
* Use optimistic concurrency control where possible
* Document concurrency limitations
* Test concurrent write operations

### Rate Limiting Implementation

* Implement intelligent rate limiting based on:
  * Client identity
  * Endpoint resource cost
  * Current system load
* Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms
* Apply different limits to different endpoints based on cost
* Communicate rate limits through HTTP headers
* Provide guidance for rate limit handling

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Bulk Operations

* Support bulk create/update/delete operations
* Implement batch processing endpoints for high-volume operations
* Document bulk operation limitations and behaviors
* Ensure atomic behavior or clear partial success handling

### Resource Expansion

* Support expanding related resources in a single request
* Allow specifying which related resources to include
* Document performance implications of expansions
* Limit expansion depth to prevent performance issues

### Pagination Implementation

* Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets
* Implement consistent page size defaults and limits
* Cache pagination results where appropriate
* Include total count only when explicitly requested
* Use keyset pagination for performance-critical endpoints

## Examples

### Cache Control Headers

```
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, must-revalidate
ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
```

### Conditional Request

```
GET /api/v1/portfolios/123
If-None-Match: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
```

### Rate Limit Headers

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 87
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1621880360
```

### Asynchronous Processing Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "taskId": "task_a1b2c3d4",
    "status": "processing",
    "estimatedCompletionTime": "2025-05-29T09:30:00Z",
    "statusUrl": "/api/v1/tasks/task_a1b2c3d4"
  }
}
```
