> Guidelines and Standards for VeritasVault API Implementation

---

## Overview

This document outlines the standards and best practices for implementing APIs within the External Interface domain of the VeritasVault platform. These standards ensure consistency, security, and usability across all APIs.

## API Standards Categories

To maintain a well-organized set of standards, we've divided API implementation guidance into the following areas:

* [Request and Response Standards](./api-standards/request-response-standards.md)
* [API Versioning Standards](./api-standards/versioning-standards.md)
* [API Security Standards](./api-standards/security-standards.md)
* [API Documentation Standards](./api-standards/documentation-standards.md)
* [API Performance Standards](./api-standards/performance-standards.md)

## General API Principles

All VeritasVault APIs should follow these core principles:

1. **REST-based Design**: Follow RESTful design principles using standard HTTP methods and status codes.

2. **JSON-first**: Use JSON as the primary data exchange format, with support for other formats when necessary.

3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent, descriptive resource naming and field naming.

4. **Resource-Oriented**: Structure APIs around resources rather than operations.

5. **Stateless**: Design APIs to be stateless, with all session state stored client-side or in appropriate backend stores.

6. **Security by Design**: Incorporate security at every level, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.

7. **Versioned**: All APIs must be properly versioned to support evolution without breaking existing clients.

8. **Well-documented**: Every API must include comprehensive documentation, including examples and error scenarios.

9. **Predictable Behavior**: APIs should behave consistently and predictably across all endpoints.

10. **Graceful Degradation**: APIs should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback.

## Implementation Reference

When implementing APIs, refer to the specific standards documents listed above, as well as these key references:

* [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
* [API Security Best Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)
* [API Gateway Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html)
* [REST API Design Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

## Compliance Verification

All APIs must be verified for compliance with these standards through:

1. Automated linting and validation tools
2. Code review processes
3. Documentation review
4. Security assessment
5. Performance testing

Refer to the specific standards documents for detailed implementation guidance in each area.
