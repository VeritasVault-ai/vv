* Drives ecosystem growth via open APIs, automation, and external bot integrations.

### Technical Impact

* Implements API gateway, adapter management, event streaming, and advanced message handling.
* Introduces robust rate-limiting, error handling, circuit breakers, key management, and protocol orchestration.
* Provides extensibility for third-party integrations, yield sources, and advanced monitoring.

### Timeline Impact

* Phase 1: API gateway, rate limiting, circuit breakers, and error taxonomy for MVP.
* Phase 2: Protocol adapter orchestration, message prioritization, event delivery, and notification routing.
* Phase 3: Advanced analytics integration, predictive alerts, monitoring, and automation.
* Phase 4: Full external bot lifecycle, auto-scaling, and SLA enforcement.

## 3. Domain Overview

The External Interface domain acts as the controlled access layer between VeritasVault and the outside world—managing all external API requests, protocol adapters, bot lifecycle, outbound event delivery, and integration health. This domain enforces security, resilience, observability, auditability, and scalability for every cross-boundary interaction.

---

## 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

### Core Functions

* API perimeter enforcement (authentication, access control, per-key/per-resource rate limiting)
* Protocol adapter and bot management (registration, upgrade, quarantine, rollback)
* Integration orchestration and lifecycle management (versioning, SLA, performance)
* Event, message, and notification delivery (prioritization, dead-letter, replay, encryption)
* Circuit breakers, error taxonomies, and fallback handling
* Audit logging of all access and integration activity
* Advanced monitoring, predictive alerting, and performance/capacity planning

### Scope Definition

**In Scope:**

* APIGateway, AdapterManager, IntegrationManager, MessageBus, MonitoringService
* API key lifecycle, adapter registration, error/failure handling, event streaming, and integration upgrades

**Out of Scope:**

* Underlying protocol logic, direct asset/trading, user-facing analytics dashboards

---

## 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

### Aggregate Roots

* **APIKey:** Aggregate for all API key creation, revocation, versioning, permissioning, and circuit breaker state.
* **Adapter:** Aggregate for registered protocol adapters and their full versioned lifecycles.
* **Integration:** Aggregate for orchestrated integrations, performance state, upgrades, and error taxonomy.
* **Bot:** Aggregate for registered automation bots, activity metrics, and resource/capacity.

### Entities

* **IntegrationEvent:** Entity for all state changes and event delivery (priority, retry, encryption).
* **Message:** Entity for queued/delivered messages, prioritization, encryption, and dead-letter status.
* **HealthMetrics:** Entity for real-time/performance metrics and predictive alerts.

### Value Objects

* **APIKeyId:** Unique identifier for API key and permissions.
* **AdapterConfig:** Immutable adapter configuration.
* **IntegrationStatus:** Enum for integration lifecycle states.
* **VersionControl:** Object for adapter/integration version, rollback, and upgrade tracking.
* **ErrorCode:** Standardized error taxonomy for integration failures.

### Domain Events

* **APIKeyCreated:** API key lifecycle initiation.
* **APIKeyRevoked:** Key revocation or circuit breaker event.
* **AdapterRegistered:** New adapter added to registry.
* **AdapterUpgraded:** Adapter upgrade or rollback event.
* **IntegrationUpgraded:** Upgrade or protocol change detected.
* **IntegrationFailed:** Error/circuit breaker triggered for an integration.
* **MessageDelivered:** Event/message successfully delivered (with confirmation).
* **PriorityEscalated:** Message or integration event escalated due to error or SLA breach.

### Repository Contracts

* **IAPIKeyRepository:** Track/manage all API keys, permissions, and circuit breaker states.
* **IAdapterRepository:** Store/manage adapters, version control, quarantine status, and configs.
* **IIntegrationRepository:** Track all integrations, SLA states, and upgrades/errors.
* **IMessageRepository:** Manage all message delivery, event streaming, retry, and dead-letter handling.
* **IMonitoringRepository:** Collect, analyze, and serve real-time health and predictive metrics.

### Invariants / Business Rules

* No external call without a valid, permissioned API key (explicit deny default).
* Adapter and bot lifecycles must be auditable, version-controlled, and rollback-capable.
* All integration events/messages must be tracked, signed, encrypted, and timestamped.
* All errors are logged with standardized taxonomy; retries and circuit breaker escalation enforced.
* Bots must be registered, resource-limited, monitored, and version controlled.
* No unaudited adapter or bot may operate in production; sandboxing/quarantine is required.

## 6. Key Interface Patterns

### Message Bus (Enhanced)

```solidity
interface IReliableMessageBus {
    struct Message {
        bytes32 id;
        uint256 priority;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 source;
        bytes32 target;
        bytes payload;
        MessageStatus status;
    }
    function publishMessage(Message memory message) external returns (bytes32);
    function confirmDelivery(bytes32 messageId) external;
    function getMessageStatus(bytes32 messageId) external view returns (MessageStatus);
    function escalatePriority(bytes32 messageId) external;
    function moveToDeadLetter(bytes32 messageId) external;
}
```

### Monitoring Service (Enhanced)

```solidity
interface IIntegrationMonitor {
    struct HealthMetrics {
        uint256 apiLatency;
        uint256 messageBacklog;
        uint256 errorRate;
        uint256 adapterHealth;
        mapping(bytes32 => uint256) resourceUtilization;
    }
    function recordMetrics(bytes32 serviceId, HealthMetrics memory metrics) external;
    function getServiceHealth(bytes32 serviceId) external view returns (HealthStatus);
    function predictiveAlert(bytes32 serviceId) external returns (bool);
}
```

### Adapter Lifecycle (Enhanced)

```solidity
interface IAdapterLifecycle {
    struct VersionControl {
        bytes32 version;
        bytes32 previousVersion;
        bytes32 configHash;
        uint256 deployedAt;
        bool canRollback;
    }
    function upgradeAdapter(bytes32 adapterId, VersionControl memory version) external;
    function rollbackAdapter(bytes32 adapterId) external returns (bool);
    function quarantineAdapter(bytes32 adapterId) external;
}
```
