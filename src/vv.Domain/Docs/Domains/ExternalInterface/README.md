# VeritasVault External Interface Domain

> Unified Gateway for API, Integration, and Cross-Chain Communication

---

## 1. Purpose

The External Interface domain serves as the unified boundary between VeritasVault and external systems, providing consistent, secure, and reliable interfaces for users, protocols, and cross-chain communication. It consolidates all external-facing services into a cohesive domain with clear responsibilities.

## 2. Key Capabilities

* API gateway for programmatic and user interface access
* Authentication and identity verification
* Cross-chain communication and asset transfer
* External protocol integration and adaptation
* Message routing and event delivery
* Price and market data integration
* Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## 3. Core Modules

### API Management

* APIGateway: Central entry point for all API requests
* APIVersioning: Compatibility and versioning
* APIDocumentation: Self-documenting interfaces
* APIMonitoring: Usage metrics and alerting

### Integration

* IntegrationManager: Protocol adapters and external system integration
* AdapterManager: External protocol lifecycle management
* Bridge: Cross-chain communication and asset transfer
* PriceOracle: Canonical price data source

### Communication

* MessageBus: Unified event routing and notification
* EventProcessor: Event handling and transformation
* NotificationService: User and system notifications
* DeliveryGuarantee: Reliable message delivery with dead letter handling

## 4. Integration Points

* **Security Domain:** For authentication, authorization, and audit
* **Core Infrastructure:** For blockchain interaction and consensus
* **Asset & Trading:** For trading interfaces and settlement
* **Risk & Compliance:** For risk checks and compliance enforcement
* **AI/ML:** For model inference and insights
* **Governance:** For parameter updates and protocol changes

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Consolidation

* Merge Gateway and Integration domain functionality
* Establish unified API management
* Consolidate authentication flows
* Standardize rate limiting and monitoring

### Phase 2: Enhanced Integration

* Unified cross-chain communication
* Standardized protocol adapters
* Comprehensive message routing
* Advanced monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities

* AI-enhanced API interfaces
* Predictive scaling and rate limiting
* Advanced cross-chain operations
* Enterprise integration capabilities
