# API Gateway Design

> Architectural Design of the VeritasVault API Gateway

---

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural design of the API Gateway for the VeritasVault platform. The API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all API requests, providing consistent access patterns, security enforcement, and request handling across all services.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Entry Point

* All API requests flow through a centralized gateway
* Consistent request processing and policy enforcement
* Unified security model across all endpoints
* Centralized monitoring and analytics

### 2. Service Abstraction

* Hide backend service complexity from API consumers
* Present a domain-oriented API rather than service-oriented
* Decouple client applications from backend service implementation
* Enable backend service evolution without client impact

### 3. Layered Defense

* Multiple layers of security controls
* Defense in depth approach to request validation
* Layered caching for performance optimization
* Progressive request processing and transformation

### 4. Resilient Design

* Fault isolation between components
* Circuit breaker patterns for service protection
* Graceful degradation under load or partial outages
* No single point of failure in gateway infrastructure

## Architectural Components

### Gateway Core

#### Request Router

* **Responsibility**: Directs incoming requests to appropriate backend services
* **Design Pattern**: Dynamic routing based on request attributes
* **Key Features**:
  * Path-based routing
  * Content-based routing
  * Version-based routing
  * Tenant-specific routing
  * Load balancing

#### Policy Enforcement Point

* **Responsibility**: Applies policies to all API requests
* **Design Pattern**: Chain of responsibility for policy evaluation
* **Key Features**:
  * Authentication verification
  * Authorization enforcement
  * Rate limiting
  * Request validation
  * SLA enforcement

#### Request Transformer

* **Responsibility**: Modifies requests between client and backend format
* **Design Pattern**: Adapter pattern for request/response transformation
* **Key Features**:
  * Protocol translation
  * Format conversion
  * Request augmentation
  * Response filtering
  * Field mapping

#### Cache Manager

* **Responsibility**: Handles caching of API responses
* **Design Pattern**: Multi-level caching with invalidation
* **Key Features**:
  * Response caching
  * Cache invalidation
  * Distributed cache synchronization
  * Cache warming
  * Conditional caching

### Supporting Services

#### Service Registry

* **Responsibility**: Maintains catalog of available backend services
* **Design Pattern**: Service discovery with health monitoring
* **Key Features**:
  * Service registration
  * Health checking
  * Metadata management
  * Configuration storage
  * Version tracking

#### Analytics Engine

* **Responsibility**: Collects and processes API usage data
* **Design Pattern**: Time-series data collection with aggregation
* **Key Features**:
  * Request logging
  * Performance metrics
  * Usage analytics
  * Error tracking
  * Pattern detection

#### Developer Portal

* **Responsibility**: Provides API documentation and developer tools
* **Design Pattern**: Self-service documentation with interactive testing
* **Key Features**:
  * API documentation
  * Code examples
  * API testing console
  * SDK generation
  * API key management

## Deployment Architecture

### Multi-Region Deployment

* Geographically distributed deployment
* Active-active configuration
* Regional routing for reduced latency
* Cross-region replication for configuration

### Gateway Scaling

* Horizontal scaling for increased capacity
* Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
* Stateless design for simplified scaling
* Load balancing across gateway instances

### High Availability Design

* No single point of failure
* Multi-zone deployment within regions
* Automated failover mechanisms
* Health monitoring and self-healing

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Patterns

* **Request-Response**: Standard HTTP request/response
* **Request Aggregation**: Combining multiple backend requests
* **Request Splitting**: Dividing one request across services
* **Service Chaining**: Sequential processing through multiple services

### Asynchronous Patterns

* **Event Publication**: Gateway as event publisher
* **Webhooks**: Callback-based asynchronous communication
* **Long Polling**: Extended request handling
* **WebSockets**: Persistent bidirectional communication

## Security Design

### Authentication

* Centralized authentication service integration
* Multiple authentication mechanism support
* Token validation and verification
* Credential isolation from backend services

### Authorization

* Fine-grained authorization policy enforcement
* Role-based access control
* Attribute-based access control
* Resource-level permission checking

### Rate Limiting

* Multi-level rate limiting (user, IP, endpoint)
* Token bucket algorithm implementation
* Rate limit response handling
* Rate limit bypass for critical operations

### Transport Security

* TLS termination at gateway
* Certificate management
* Secure cipher configuration
* Internal service communication encryption

## Implementation Strategy

### Technology Selection Criteria

* Scalability requirements
* Performance characteristics
* Extensibility capabilities
* Operational complexity
* Integration requirements

### Platform Options

* **Custom-Built Gateway**:
  * Complete control over functionality
  * Tailored to exact requirements
  * Higher development and maintenance cost
  * Extended implementation timeline

* **API Gateway Products**:
  * Kong, Amazon API Gateway, Azure API Management
  * Faster implementation timeline
  * Lower development costs
  * Potentially limited customization

* **Service Mesh Integration**:
  * Istio, Linkerd, Consul
  * Integrated with container orchestration
  * Advanced traffic management
  * Distributed tracing capabilities

### Hybrid Approach Recommendation

* Use commercial API Gateway product as foundation
* Extend with custom plugins for specialized needs
* Integrate with service mesh for containerized services
* Build custom components only where products fall short

## Evolution Strategy

### Version 1: Foundation

* Core routing capabilities
* Basic authentication and authorization
* Simple rate limiting
* Initial monitoring

### Version 2: Enhanced Security

* Advanced authentication mechanisms
* Fine-grained authorization
* Comprehensive rate limiting
* Threat protection

### Version 3: Developer Experience

* API documentation portal
* SDK generation
* Enhanced analytics
* Developer self-service

### Version 4: Advanced Patterns

* Request aggregation
* Service composition
* Enhanced caching
* Protocol translation
