# Authentication & Authorization

> Secure Access Controls for VeritasVault Platform

---

## Overview

The Authentication and Authorization system provides comprehensive security controls that verify user identities, manage sessions, and enforce appropriate access permissions across the VeritasVault platform.

## Key Capabilities

### Authentication Methods

* **Password-Based**: Traditional username and password authentication
* **Multi-Factor**: Additional verification using multiple authentication factors
* **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC**: Standard-compliant token-based authentication
* **Social Login**: Integration with common social identity providers
* **Enterprise SSO**: Single sign-on with enterprise identity systems
* **Biometric**: Fingerprint, face recognition, and other biometric factors
* **Passwordless**: Authentication without traditional passwords

### Session Management

* **Token Issuance**: Generation of secure access tokens
* **Token Validation**: Verification of token authenticity and validity
* **Session Lifecycle**: Controlled session duration and renewal
* **Session Revocation**: Immediate termination of sessions when needed
* **Refresh Tokens**: Secure renewal of sessions without reauthentication
* **Token Storage**: Secure client-side token management
* **Cross-Device Sessions**: Consistent experience across multiple devices

### Access Control

* **Role-Based Access Control**: Permissions based on assigned roles
* **Attribute-Based Access Control**: Dynamic permissions based on attributes
* **Resource-Level Authorization**: Granular control of specific resources
* **Permission Delegation**: Secure transfer of limited permissions
* **Context-Aware Authorization**: Permissions based on context factors
* **Hierarchical Access**: Structured permission inheritance
* **Segregation of Duties**: Prevention of conflicting permissions

### Identity Management

* **User Profiles**: Comprehensive user information management
* **Role Assignment**: Association of users with appropriate roles
* **Group Management**: Grouping of users for permission assignment
* **Organizational Hierarchy**: Structured representation of organizations
* **Self-Service**: User management of their own profile and settings
* **Administrative Controls**: Management tools for administrators
* **Identity Verification**: Validation of user identity claims

### Security Features

* **Brute Force Protection**: Defense against password guessing
* **Session Hijacking Prevention**: Protection of active sessions
* **Credential Storage**: Secure handling of authentication credentials
* **Account Recovery**: Secure recovery of compromised accounts
* **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Identification of unusual behavior
* **Risk-Based Authentication**: Adaptive security based on risk factors
* **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive recording of security events

### Enterprise Integration

* **Active Directory Integration**: Connection with Microsoft AD/Azure AD
* **LDAP Support**: Integration with LDAP directories
* **SAML 2.0**: Enterprise single sign-on via SAML
* **SCIM Provisioning**: Automated user provisioning
* **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Dynamic user creation on first login
* **Identity Federation**: Cross-organization identity trust
* **Delegated Administration**: External management of identities

### Developer Tools

* **Authentication SDKs**: Client libraries for authentication
* **Authorization Middleware**: Reusable authorization components
* **Token Utilities**: Tools for token handling and validation
* **Authorization Testing**: Tools for testing access controls
* **Identity Simulation**: Development tools for identity testing
* **Permission Visualization**: Tools for understanding access rights
* **Security Debugging**: Specialized debugging for security issues

## Implementation Considerations

* Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers
* Choose appropriate authentication factors for different security contexts
* Implement fine-grained authorization with least privilege
* Design for scalability and performance under high authentication loads
* Ensure compatibility with enterprise identity systems
* Create intuitive security user experiences
* Plan for security incident response

## Security Requirements

* Protect all authentication credentials in transit and at rest
* Implement proper password hashing with modern algorithms
* Secure token generation with appropriate entropy
* Enforce strong password policies while maintaining usability
* Protect against common authentication attacks (replay, CSRF, etc.)
* Implement comprehensive security logging
* Regularly audit all access control configurations

## Performance Considerations

* Optimize token validation for high-volume operations
* Implement efficient caching of authorization decisions
* Balance security and usability for frequent operations
* Consider stateless authentication where appropriate
* Optimize session management for scale
* Implement efficient permission checking algorithms
* Design for high availability of authentication services
