# API Gateway

> Unified Access Layer for VeritasVault Services

---

## Overview

The API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all API requests to the VeritasVault platform, providing consistent access patterns, security enforcement, and request handling across all services.

## Key Capabilities

### Request Routing

* **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service location and routing
* **Load Balancing**: Distribution of requests across service instances
* **Path-Based Routing**: Directing requests based on URL patterns
* **Content-Based Routing**: Routing based on request content
* **Version-Based Routing**: Directing requests to appropriate API versions
* **Failover Routing**: Rerouting requests when services are unavailable
* **Sticky Sessions**: Consistent routing for session-based operations

### API Versioning

* **Version Identification**: Clear version indicators in URLs and headers
* **Compatibility Layers**: Support for backward compatibility
* **Version Lifecycle**: Managed deprecation and retirement of versions
* **Documentation Versioning**: Version-specific API documentation
* **Client Notification**: Proactive communication of version changes
* **Version Coexistence**: Support for multiple active versions
* **Migration Paths**: Guidance for upgrading between versions

### Request Processing

* **Request Validation**: Schema-based validation of incoming requests
* **Content Negotiation**: Support for multiple content types
* **Request Transformation**: Adaptation of request format when needed
* **Parameter Handling**: Consistent processing of query parameters
* **Header Management**: Standardized handling of HTTP headers
* **Method Handling**: Support for appropriate HTTP methods
* **Batch Processing**: Handling multiple operations in a single request

### Response Handling

* **Response Formatting**: Consistent response structure
* **Content Type Conversion**: Transformation between formats
* **Error Standardization**: Uniform error response structure
* **Status Code Usage**: Appropriate HTTP status codes
* **Pagination Support**: Consistent paging of large result sets
* **Field Selection**: Support for requesting specific response fields
* **Response Compression**: Efficient response delivery

### Security Enforcement

* **Authentication Verification**: Validation of authentication credentials
* **Authorization Checks**: Enforcement of access permissions
* **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of excessive use
* **IP Filtering**: Control of access by IP address
* **Attack Protection**: Defense against common API attacks
* **Request Encryption**: Secure transmission of sensitive data
* **Security Headers**: Implementation of security-related headers

### Monitoring & Analytics

* **Request Logging**: Detailed logging of API activity
* **Performance Metrics**: Measurement of response times
* **Usage Analytics**: Tracking of API consumption patterns
* **Error Tracking**: Monitoring of failure rates and patterns
* **SLA Monitoring**: Tracking of service level agreement compliance
* **Consumer Analytics**: Insights into API consumer behavior
* **Trend Analysis**: Identification of usage patterns over time

### Developer Experience

* **Interactive Documentation**: Explorable API documentation
* **Code Examples**: Sample code for common operations
* **SDK Generation**: Client libraries for multiple languages
* **Developer Portal**: Resources for API consumers
* **Sandbox Environment**: Safe testing environment
* **API Change Log**: History of API modifications
* **Developer Support**: Assistance for API consumers

## Implementation Considerations

* Implement a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Choose appropriate gateway technology based on scaling requirements
* Design for high availability and fault tolerance
* Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
* Create detailed documentation for both internal and external consumers
* Establish clear API governance and versioning policies
* Implement automated testing for all API endpoints

## Security Requirements

* Implement TLS for all communications
* Use appropriate authentication mechanisms for different client types
* Implement granular authorization for all endpoints
* Apply rate limiting based on client identity and request patterns
* Validate all input to prevent injection attacks
* Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
* Implement proper logging while protecting sensitive information

## Performance Considerations

* Implement efficient request routing
* Use appropriate caching strategies
* Optimize payload sizes
* Implement connection pooling
* Monitor and optimize database queries
* Consider asynchronous processing for long-running operations
* Implement circuit breakers for dependent services
