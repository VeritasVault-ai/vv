# VeritasVault Integration & Analytics (Refined)

> External Integration, Access Control, Analytics, and Cross-Chain Interop

---

## 1. Overview

Defines the modular, security-first architecture for integrating VeritasVault with external blockchains, protocols, and analytics infrastructure. Encompasses cross-chain bridges, price oracles, messaging, access control, analytics pipelines, financial modeling, and real-time monitoring. All interfaces and events are engineered for robust interoperability, auditability, and operational resilience—"move fast" is allowed only if you never break things.

## 4. Implementation & Integration Guidelines

### External Protocol Integration

* All APIs must be versioned, OpenAPI-documented, and support error codes/fallbacks
* Strong authentication (OAuth2/JWT/digital signatures) is mandatory
* Rate limiting, abuse detection, and circuit breaker controls required for every integration
* Rollback, retry, and fallback logic enforced for all adapter and bridge flows

### Analytics & Data Handling

* Define every tracked metric, KPI, and alert in advance—no "anonymous" or undefined metrics
* Data retention strictly matches compliance and operational requirements
* All analytics/reporting endpoints are RBAC-protected
* Analytics pipelines must support audit trails, staging, and result validation
* Export options: CSV, PDF, XBRL, real-time streaming

### Financial Modeling

* Market data for financial models must be validated and anomaly-checked
* All model parameters and assumptions must be documented and auditable
* Financial models must be backtested against historical data before production use
* Portfolio recommendations must include risk metrics and confidence intervals
* Model outputs must be versioned and retained for compliance purposes

### Access & Identity Management

* All actors are mapped to DIDs; all access events are logged and auditable
* Whitelist/onboarding flows are multi-step, with human-in-the-loop where required
* KYC/AML checks are versioned, upgradable, and independently audited
* Fine-grained access to sensitive analytics and data lake endpoints

### Monitoring, Error Handling, & Performance

* Real-time system monitoring with circuit breakers and predictive alerts
* Health metrics tracked for all critical components (latency, error rate, throughput)
* Detailed error codes/messages for all API responses
* Automated failover and recovery playbooks for bridge/oracle/message bus failures
* Capacity planning and stress-testing required pre-launch
