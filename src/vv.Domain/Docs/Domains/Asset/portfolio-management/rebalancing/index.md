# Rebalancing Strategies

> Approaches for maintaining optimal portfolio allocations over time

---

## Overview

Portfolio rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio's assets to maintain the desired asset allocation. As market movements cause portfolio weights to drift from their targets, rebalancing strategies provide systematic approaches to restore the intended asset mix while considering trading costs, taxes, and market conditions.

## Key Rebalancing Approaches

This section covers various rebalancing methodologies:

* **[Calendar Rebalancing](./calendar-rebalancing.md)**: Time-based rebalancing at predetermined intervals
* **[Threshold Rebalancing](./threshold-rebalancing.md)**: Rebalancing when allocations drift beyond specified boundaries
* **[Tactical Rebalancing](./tactical-rebalancing.md)**: Combining strategic rebalancing with short-term market views
* **[Optimal Rebalancing](./optimal-rebalancing.md)**: Advanced techniques to optimize the trade-off between costs and tracking error

## Rebalancing Considerations

When implementing rebalancing strategies, investors should consider:

* Trading costs and market impact
* Tax implications of realized gains
* Risk control benefits
* Operational complexity
* Market condition influences
* Portfolio size and liquidity constraints

For a comprehensive overview of rebalancing concepts and their role in portfolio management, see the [Rebalancing Overview](./rebalancing-overview.md) document.
