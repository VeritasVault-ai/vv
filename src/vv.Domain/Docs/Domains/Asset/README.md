## Domain Scope

This domain provides infrastructure for:

* Standardized digital asset representation and lifecycle management
* Advanced trading mechanisms with regulatory compliance
* Portfolio management with optimization capabilities
* Market-capitalization-weighted indices and portfolios
* Deterministic, **atomic settlement** with cryptographic finality guarantees

It collaborates closely with the **AI/ML**, **Risk & Compliance**, and **Core Infrastructure** domains to provide a robust financial ecosystem.

## Security & Compliance

All security, audit, and compliance requirements for this domain are defined in the centralized **[VeritasVault Unified Security & Audit Standard](../../SECURITY.md)**.  
Key implications for the Asset domain:

* Trades and settlements must emit tamper-proof events signed per the standard.
* The **Settlement Protocol** enforces circuit-breaker checks and rollback logic specified in the security standard.
* Rate-limiting and DoS protections apply to liquidity operations and order submission endpoints.
* All privileged contract upgrades (e.g., AMM logic) require the multi-sig thresholds and time-locks defined in the standard.

Refer to the security document for detailed threat models, incident response playbooks, and audit logging requirements.
