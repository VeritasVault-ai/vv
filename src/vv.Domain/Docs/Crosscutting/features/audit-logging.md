# Audit Logging

> Immutable, Signed, and Cryptographically Verifiable Event Logs

---

## Overview

The audit logging system provides immutable, tamper-evident records of all security-relevant activities across the VeritasVault platform.

* Normalize identifiers across log sources
* Ensure consistent timestamp formatting with timezone
* Include correlation identifiers for related events

### Performance Optimization

* Implement efficient log collection pipelines
* Use batching for high-volume logging
* Consider compression for storage efficiency
* Optimize signature and verification operations
* Balance between completeness and performance

### Privacy Considerations
