# Versioned Security Policies

> Authentication, Access Control, Rate Limiting, and Circuit-Breaker Logic

---

## Overview

Versioned security policies provide the foundation for VeritasVault's zero-trust security model. These policies govern authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and automated protective responses across the entire platform.

## Core Capabilities

### Authentication & Access

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

* **Factor Categories**:
  * Knowledge factors (passwords, PINs)
  * Possession factors (hardware tokens, mobile devices)
  * Inherence factors (biometrics)
  * Context factors (location, device, time)

* **MFA Implementation**:
  * Progressive authentication based on risk
  * Adaptive challenge selection
  * Configurable factor requirements by operation risk
  * Anti-replay protections
  * Secure authentication state management

* **Authentication Flows**:
  * Initial authentication
  * Step-up authentication for high-risk operations
  * Re-authentication for session extension
  * Recovery pathways
  * Delegation authentication

#### Role-Based Access Control

* **Role Architecture**:
  * Hierarchical role structure
  * Role inheritance patterns
  * Least-privilege principle enforcement
  * Separation of duties
  * Dynamic role assignment

* **Permission Management**:
  * Fine-grained permission definitions
  * Operation-level authorizations
  * Resource-scoped permissions
  * Temporal constraints
  * Conditional authorizations

* **Policy Enforcement**:
  * Centralized policy decision points
  * Distributed policy enforcement points
  * Real-time policy evaluation
  * Context-aware access decisions
  * Authorization audit trails

### Rate Limiting

#### Limit Types

* **Request-Based Limits**:
  * Per-endpoint rate limits
  * Per-user request quotas
  * Global request thresholds
  * Burst allowances
  * Progressive throttling

* **Resource Consumption Limits**:
  * Compute resource caps
  * Storage utilization limits
  * Network bandwidth constraints
  * Database connection limits
  * Query complexity restrictions

* **Operation-Specific Limits**:
  * Transaction rate controls
  * API-specific thresholds
  * Administrative operation restrictions
  * Risk-based operational limits
  * Time-bound execution constraints

#### Enforcement Mechanisms

* **Detection Methods**:
  * Request counting
  * Token bucket algorithm
  * Leaky bucket algorithm
  * Fixed window counting
  * Sliding window counting

* **Response Actions**:
  * Request queuing
  * Request rejection
  * Progressive slowdown
  * Alternate resource routing
  * Graceful degradation

* **Dynamic Adjustment**:
  * Load-based limit adjustment
  * Time-of-day variations
  * Priority-based allocation
  * Emergency limit overrides
  * Gradual limit recovery

### Circuit Breakers

#### Trigger Conditions

* **Error Rate Breakers**:
  * Consecutive error thresholds
  * Error percentage thresholds
  * Error type categorization
  * Error severity weighting
  * Progressive error response

* **Performance Breakers**:
  * Response time thresholds
  * Resource utilization triggers
  * Concurrent request limits
  * System load indicators
  * Memory pressure detection

* **Security Breakers**:
  * Authentication failure patterns
  * Authorization anomalies
  * Input validation failures
  * Suspicious request patterns
  * Threat intelligence triggers

#### Circuit States

* **Closed State**:
  * Normal operation
  * Error monitoring
  * Performance measurement
  * Security assessment
  * State transition criteria

* **Open State**:
  * Request rejection
  * Fallback response generation
  * Error reporting
  * Recovery attempt scheduling
  * Notification generation

* **Half-Open State**:
  * Limited request testing
  * Progressive capacity restoration
  * Canary request processing
  * Success rate evaluation
  * Full recovery criteria

#### Recovery Patterns

* **Automatic Recovery**:
  * Time-based reset attempts
  * Exponential backoff
  * Health check verification
  * Graduated capacity restoration
  * Circuit state persistence

* **Manual Intervention**:
  * Administrative override
  * Forced circuit reset
  * Configuration adjustment
  * Root cause verification
  * Recovery validation

* **Fallback Mechanisms**:
  * Default responses
  * Cached data utilization
  * Degraded functionality
  * Alternative service paths
  * Graceful degradation modes

## Versioning Framework

### Version Control

* **Policy Versioning**:
  * Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
  * Version history preservation
  * Change documentation
  * Effective date tracking
  * Author and approval tracking

* **Deployment Control**:
  * Staged rollout
  * A/B testing capability
  * Canary deployment
  * Rollback capabilities
  * Version pinning

* **Compatibility Management**:
  * Forward compatibility guarantees
  * Backward compatibility support
  * Deprecation processes
  * Migration paths
  * Legacy version support periods

### Testability

* **Policy Testing**:
  * Automated policy validation
  * Test scenario coverage
  * Compliance verification
  * Performance impact assessment
  * Security regression testing

* **Simulation Capabilities**:
  * Attack simulation
  * Load testing
  * Failure scenario testing
  * Edge case validation
  * Chaos engineering

* **Validation Framework**:
  * Test case management
  * Coverage reporting
  * Validation attestation
  * Test automation
  * Continuous validation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Policy Definition

* Use declarative policy language
* Maintain separation of policy and enforcement
* Establish clear versioning conventions
* Document policy intent and rationale
* Provide examples for common scenarios

### Policy Enforcement

* Implement consistent enforcement points
* Use centralized policy decision services
* Cache policy decisions appropriately
* Log all policy evaluations
* Provide clear denial reasons

### Policy Maintenance

* Review policies on a regular schedule
* Test policy changes thoroughly
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Document all policy changes
* Analyze policy effectiveness metrics
