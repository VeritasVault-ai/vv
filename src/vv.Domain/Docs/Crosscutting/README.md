# VeritasVault Cross-Cutting Concerns – README

> Platform-Wide Security, Auditability, and Compliance for Institutional Trust

---

## Purpose

This artifact defines the universal controls and operational principles that underpin VeritasVault’s entire protocol stack. Cross-cutting concerns are not “nice-to-haves”—they are non-negotiable protocol requirements covering:

* Zero-trust security (multi-layer auth, access, encryption, circuit breakers)
* Immutable and verifiable audit logging
* Continuous monitoring and AI/ML-powered anomaly detection
* Automated compliance checks and attestations
* Operational resilience (backup, disaster recovery, automated failover)
* Versioned, testable, and auditable controls for every phase and release

---

## Why It Matters

* **Trust:** Institutional and regulatory users require auditable, tamper-proof controls at every layer.
* **Risk Reduction:** Systemic failure, undetected breach, or compliance drift is a protocol existential risk.
* **Operational Excellence:** Only with deep automation, monitoring, and tested DR can VeritasVault scale securely.

---

## Coverage & Boundaries

* **In Scope:** Security, compliance, audit, monitoring, backup/restore, DR, incident response, operational automation, and integration.
* **Out of Scope:** Business logic, UI/UX, domain-specific on-chain transactions (see other artifacts).
* **Dependencies:** Core infrastructure, AI/ML domain, asset/trading, risk/compliance, analytics/integration, governance, and gateway domains.

---

## Key Features

* **Versioned Security Policies** – Auth/access, multi-factor, rate limiting, and circuit-breaker logic, versioned and testable.
* **Audit Logging** – Immutable, signed, and cryptographically verifiable event and ops logs. Automated audit trail validation.
* **Compliance Framework** – Automated enforcement and periodic attestation for SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and other standards.
* **Monitoring/Alerting** – Real-time metrics, AI/ML anomaly detection, and actionable alerting for all thresholds.
* **Disaster Recovery (DR)** – Full playbooks, versioned backups, testable restore/rollback, and automated failover.
* **Operational Automation** – Rollback, upgrade, and scaling tasks orchestrated via event-driven ops workflows.
* **Integration Patterns** – API versioning, webhooks, event streaming, CLI integration, and extensibility.

## Implementation Guidance

* **Follow the guidelines** in \[VeritasVault-CrossCutting-Concerns-Guidelines.md] for best practices, mandatory controls, implementation priorities, and pitfalls to avoid.
* **Every new control** (security, audit, DR, automation) must be versioned, testable, and integration-ready before merging to main.
* **Compliance checks** and audit trail validation are go/no-go gates for all releases—no soft launches.
* **Operational DR/backup drills** must be run on schedule (not just after change). Any failure blocks rollout until remediated.
* **SLAs and SLOs** must be explicitly defined for uptime, backup, incident response, compliance coverage, and cost controls.
* **API and automation integrations** must support backward-compatible versioning and test hooks for all supported domains.

## Using This Artifact

1. **Reference this README and the guidelines doc before** any release, upgrade, or incident drill.
2. **Adopt the interface examples** in design/implementation of new cross-domain controls.
3. **Align all domain artifacts** with the requirements and best practices specified here.
4. **Escalate any ambiguity or gap** in controls to the security/ops leads—no exceptions for shortcuts.
5. **Append new integration or operational patterns** as required, referencing version and change history.
