# Operational Monitoring

> Real-time monitoring, alerting, and observability framework for the VeritasVault platform

---

## 1. Overview

The Operational Monitoring framework provides comprehensive visibility into the VeritasVault platform's health, performance, and operational status. This document outlines the monitoring architecture, key metrics, alerting strategies, and integration with operational processes that ensure reliable and responsive system operations.

## 2. Monitoring Architecture

### Monitoring Layers

* **Infrastructure Monitoring** - Physical and virtual resource metrics
* **Platform Monitoring** - Kubernetes, database, and middleware components
* **Service Monitoring** - Microservice health and performance
* **Business Monitoring** - Business process and transaction flows
* **User Experience Monitoring** - End-user experience and satisfaction

### Collection and Storage

* **Metrics Pipeline:**
  * Collection: Prometheus agents, exporters, and scrapers
  * Processing: Metric aggregation, correlation, and enrichment
  * Storage: Time-series databases with high availability
  * Retention: Tiered storage with aggregation policies

* **Logging Pipeline:**
  * Collection: Fluentd/Fluent Bit aggregators
  * Processing: Parsing, filtering, and enrichment
  * Storage: Elasticsearch clusters with shard management
  * Retention: Index lifecycle management with archiving

* **Tracing Pipeline:**
  * Collection: OpenTelemetry instrumentation
  * Processing: Sampling, filtering, and correlation
  * Storage: Jaeger/Tempo backend
  * Retention: Selective storage based on significance

## 3. Key Metrics and Indicators

### System Health Metrics

| Category | Key Metrics | Sampling | Retention |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Host Metrics | CPU, memory, disk, network | 10s | 30d raw, 1y aggregated |
| Container Metrics | CPU, memory, restarts | 10s | 30d raw, 1y aggregated |
| Database Metrics | Connections, queries, latency | 30s | 30d raw, 1y aggregated |
| Queue Metrics | Depth, processing rate, age | 10s | 15d raw, 3m aggregated |
| Cache Metrics | Hit rate, eviction, size | 30s | 15d raw, 3m aggregated |

### Business Health Indicators

* **Transaction Processing:**
  * Success rate: >99.95% target
  * Processing time: <2s target
  * Volume trends: Within 20% of forecast

* **Data Processing:**
  * Ingestion latency: <5min target
  * Data quality score: >98% target
  * Processing backlog: <15min target

* **User Activity:**
  * Active users: Within 15% of forecast
  * Session duration: Within normal distribution
  * Feature utilization: Within expected patterns

* **System Utilization:**
  * Peak capacity utilization: <70% target
  * Resource efficiency ratio: >85% target
  * Cost per transaction: Within budget targets

## 4. Visualization and Dashboards

### Dashboard Hierarchy

* **Executive Dashboards:**
  * Business KPI summary
  * Service level agreement status
  * Operational health overview
  * Incident and problem summary

* **Operational Dashboards:**
  * Service health and performance
  * Resource utilization and capacity
  * Error rates and quality metrics
  * Alert and incident status

* **Technical Dashboards:**
  * Detailed component metrics
  * Dependency mapping and flow
  * Performance bottleneck analysis
  * Log and trace correlation

### Visualization Standards

* **Color Coding:**
  * Green: Normal operating conditions
  * Yellow: Warning or approaching thresholds
  * Orange: Performance degradation
  * Red: Critical issues or outages

* **Time Range Defaults:**
  * Operational: Last 24 hours with 5-minute resolution
  * Tactical: Last 7 days with 1-hour resolution
  * Strategic: Last 90 days with 1-day resolution

* **Metric Presentation:**
  * Include historical norms and baselines
  * Show forecasted ranges where applicable
  * Highlight anomalies and deviations
  * Provide drill-down capabilities to source data

## 5. Alerting Framework

### Alert Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Critical | Service unavailable or data loss | Immediate (24/7) | Auto-escalation after 15min |
| High | Significant degradation | 30min (24/7) | Auto-escalation after 1hr |
| Medium | Limited impact, workaround available | 4 hours (business hours) | Manual escalation |
| Low | Minor issue, no immediate impact | 24 hours (business hours) | No auto-escalation |

### Alert Channels

* **Primary Channels:**
  * On-call notification system (PagerDuty)
  * Team communication platform (Slack)
  * Email for non-urgent notifications
  * SMS for critical escalations

* **Escalation Paths:**
  * L1: Operations team
  * L2: Service-specific engineering team
  * L3: Senior engineering and architecture
  * L4: Executive leadership

### Alert Design Principles

* **Actionable:** Every alert must have a clear action plan
* **Accurate:** Minimize false positives through tuning
* **Relevant:** Direct to the right team with proper context
* **Timely:** Provide enough lead time for preventative action
* **Informative:** Include diagnostic information and links

## 6. Observability Strategy

### Instrumentation Standards

* **Service Instrumentation:**
  * RED metrics (Requests, Errors, Duration) for all services
  * Custom business metrics for domain-specific monitoring
  * Health check endpoints with standardized format
  * Correlation ID propagation across service boundaries

* **Code Instrumentation:**
  * Automated tracing for service boundaries
  * Performance metrics for critical paths
  * Resource utilization tracking
  * Error context enrichment

### Correlation Capabilities

* **Trace-to-Log Correlation:**
  * Embed trace IDs in all log entries
  * Link logs to corresponding traces in UI
  * Aggregate logs by trace context
  * Search across dimensions

* **Metric-to-Trace Correlation:**
  * Link metrics to exemplar traces
  * Identify representative traces for anomalies
  * Correlate performance metrics with traces
  * Provide context-based navigation

## 7. Operational Integration

### Incident Management

* **Detection:**
  * Automatic incident creation from alerts
  * Intelligent grouping of related alerts
  * Severity classification based on impact
  * Contextual information gathering

* **Response:**
  * Guided response procedures
  * Automated diagnostic information collection
  * Impact assessment dashboards
  * Collaboration and communication channels

* **Resolution:**
  * Post-incident analysis automation
  * Metric-based resolution verification
  * Recovery monitoring
  * Learning and improvement feedback

### Capacity Management

* **Trend Analysis:**
  * Resource utilization trends
  * Growth pattern identification
  * Seasonal variation mapping
  * Anomaly detection and forecasting

* **Capacity Planning:**
  * What-if scenario modeling
  * Resource requirement forecasting
  * Cost optimization recommendations
  * Scaling plan generation

## 8. Implementation Guidelines

### Monitoring Deployment

1. **Core Infrastructure:**
   * Prometheus and Alertmanager clusters
   * Grafana visualization platform
   * Elasticsearch and Kibana for logging
   * Jaeger/Tempo for distributed tracing

2. **Agent Deployment:**
   * Node exporters on all hosts
   * cAdvisor/Kubelet for container metrics
   * Service-specific exporters
   * Application instrumentation libraries

3. **Integration Layer:**
   * Alert aggregation and deduplication
   * Cross-platform correlation engine
   * Notification routing system
   * Automation integration APIs

### Best Practices

* **Metric Naming:**
  * Follow consistent naming conventions
  * Use meaningful prefixes and suffixes
  * Include relevant dimensions
  * Document all custom metrics

* **Alert Tuning:**
  * Start with conservative thresholds
  * Analyze alert patterns and adjust
  * Implement alert fatigue monitoring
  * Regular review and cleanup

* **Scaling Considerations:**
  * Implement metric cardinality controls
  * Use appropriate sampling rates
  * Plan storage capacity with retention policies
  * Consider federated deployment for large-scale
