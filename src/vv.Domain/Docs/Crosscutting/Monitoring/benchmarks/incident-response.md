# Incident Response

> Structured approach to handling operational incidents

---

## 1. Overview

The Incident Response framework provides a structured, repeatable approach to detecting, managing, and resolving operational incidents across the VeritasVault platform. This document serves as an entry point to our incident management procedures, with detailed documentation split into specialized areas.

## 2. Documentation Structure

To maintain clarity and specialization, our incident response documentation is split into the following focused files:

* [Incident Classification](./incident-response/incident-classification.md) - Severity levels and impact dimensions
* [Incident Lifecycle](./incident-response/incident-lifecycle.md) - End-to-end incident management process
* [Roles & Responsibilities](./incident-response/roles-responsibilities.md) - Team structure and responsibilities
* [Communication Templates](./incident-response/communication-templates.md) - Standard notification formats
* [Response Playbooks](./incident-response/response-playbooks.md) - Specific incident handling procedures
* [Post-Incident Activities](./incident-response/post-incident.md) - Review and improvement processes

## 3. Key Principles

Our incident response processes adhere to these core principles:

* **Clear Ownership** - Every incident has a designated commander
* **Effective Communication** - Timely and appropriate stakeholder updates
* **Data-Driven Decisions** - Actions based on metrics and evidence
* **Continuous Learning** - Structured post-incident improvement process
* **Blameless Culture** - Focus on systems, not individuals
* **Automation First** - Automated detection and recovery where possible

## 4. Integration Points

The Incident Response framework integrates with:

* **Alerting System** - For automated incident detection
* **Monitoring Dashboard** - For real-time system visibility
* **Status Page** - For external communication
* **Knowledge Base** - For resolution guidance and playbooks
* **Change Management** - For tracking corrective actions
