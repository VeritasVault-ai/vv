# Storage Performance Benchmarks

> Performance standards and metrics for database and storage systems

---

## 1. Overview

This document defines the performance benchmarks for storage systems within the VeritasVault platform, including databases, object storage, and distributed file systems. These standards ensure that storage operations meet the performance, reliability, and scalability requirements necessary for financial data management and analysis.

## 2. Storage Systems Coverage

These benchmarks apply to the following storage systems:

* **Time Series Databases** - Specialized storage for financial time series data
* **Relational Databases** - Core transactional and reference data storage
* **Document Databases** - Flexible schema storage for composite documents
* **Object Storage** - Long-term data archiving and large object storage
* **In-Memory Data Stores** - High-performance caching and real-time access
* **Distributed File Systems** - Large-scale analytical data storage
