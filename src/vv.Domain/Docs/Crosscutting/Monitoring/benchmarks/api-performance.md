# API Performance Benchmarks

> Gateway and service API performance standards and testing criteria

---

## 1. Overview

This document defines the performance standards, testing methodologies, and acceptance criteria for all APIs within the VeritasVault platform. It covers REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and internal service-to-service communication interfaces.

## 2. Performance Standards

### Response Time Standards

| API Category | P50 | P95 | P99 | Maximum |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Public REST APIs | < 100ms | < 250ms | < 500ms | 2000ms |
| Internal Service APIs | < 50ms | < 100ms | < 200ms | 1000ms |
| GraphQL Queries | < 150ms | < 350ms | < 700ms | 3000ms |
| GraphQL Mutations | < 200ms | < 450ms | < 800ms | 3500ms |
| WebSocket Messages | < 50ms | < 100ms | < 200ms | 500ms |

### Throughput Standards

| API Category | Sustained Rate | Peak Rate | Concurrent Requests |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Public REST APIs | 2,000 req/s | 10,000 req/s | 5,000 |
| Internal Service APIs | 5,000 req/s | 20,000 req/s | 10,000 |
| GraphQL Endpoints | 1,000 req/s | 5,000 req/s | 2,500 |
| WebSocket Connections | 50,000 connections | 200,000 connections | N/A |
| WebSocket Messages | 100,000 msg/s | 500,000 msg/s | N/A |

### Error Rate Standards

| API Category | Normal Operation | Peak Load | Degraded Mode |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Public REST APIs | < 0.1% | < 0.5% | < 2% |
| Internal Service APIs | < 0.05% | < 0.2% | < 1% |
| GraphQL Endpoints | < 0.2% | < 1% | < 3% |
| WebSocket Messages | < 0.1% | < 0.5% | < 2% |

## 3. Testing Methodology

### Test Types

* **Baseline Performance Tests:**
  * Single-request latency tests
  * Zero-load response time measurement
  * Connection establishment timing
  * Authentication overhead measurement

* **Load Testing:**
  * Gradual ramp-up to sustained throughput
  * Steady-state operation at target load
  * Mixed operation workloads
  * Realistic user behavior patterns

* **Stress Testing:**
  * Maximum throughput determination
  * Breaking point identification
  * Error handling under extreme load
  * Recovery time measurement

* **Endurance Testing:**
  * 24-hour continuous operation
  * Memory leak detection
  * Performance degradation measurement
  * Connection stability verification

### Test Scenarios

1. **Standard API Flow:**
   * Authentication and token acquisition
   * Standard CRUD operations
   * Typical query patterns
   * Normal payload sizes

2. **Complex Query Patterns:**
   * Deep object graph retrievals
   * Multi-entity transactions
   * Filtered collection queries
   * Sorting and pagination operations

3. **Edge Cases:**
   * Maximum payload sizes
   * Minimum/maximum parameter values
   * Boundary condition testing
   * Error path performance

4. **Security Impact:**
   * Authentication performance
   * Authorization overhead
   * Rate limiting behavior
   * Input validation performance

## 4. Test Environment

### Test Infrastructure

* **Load Generation:**
  * Distributed load generation cluster
  * Geographic distribution of request origins
  * Realistic network conditions simulation
  * Request rate control and synchronization

* **Environment Configuration:**
  * Production-equivalent infrastructure
  * Isolated test networks
  * Controlled external dependencies
  * Representative data volumes

* **Monitoring:**
  * End-to-end request tracing
  * Component-level performance metrics
  * Resource utilization tracking
  * Bottleneck identification tools

### Test Data

* **Data Volume:**
  * 50% of production data scale for standard tests
  * 100% of production data scale for scalability tests
  * 200% of projected annual growth for future-proofing tests

* **Data Characteristics:**
  * Representative entity distribution
  * Realistic relationship complexity
  * Production-like query patterns
  * Varied payload sizes and structures

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### Critical Path APIs

All APIs on critical user and system paths must meet:

* 99.9% of requests within response time standards
* Error rates below specified thresholds
* Successful completion of all endurance tests
* Linear scalability up to 2x projected peak load

### Non-Critical APIs

APIs on non-critical paths must meet:

* 99% of requests within response time standards
* Error rates below specified thresholds
* Successful completion of basic load tests
* Graceful degradation under excessive load

### Regression Prevention

Performance regression testing must verify:

* No more than 10% degradation from previous release
* No new bottlenecks introduced
* Memory usage patterns remain stable
* Connection handling remains efficient

## 6. Common Optimizations

* **Query Optimization:**
  * Efficient database query patterns
  * Appropriate indexing strategies
  * Query result caching
  * Execution plan optimization

* **Payload Optimization:**
  * Response filtering and projection
  * Compression for large payloads
  * Pagination for large collections
  * Sparse fieldsets and partial responses

* **Connection Optimization:**
  * Connection pooling
  * Keep-alive optimization
  * Request batching
  * Asynchronous processing

* **Caching Strategies:**
  * Response caching policies
  * Cache invalidation mechanisms
  * Distributed cache implementation
  * Edge caching for public APIs
