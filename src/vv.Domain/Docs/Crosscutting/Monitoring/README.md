# VeritasVault Cross-Domain Monitoring Framework

> Unified Monitoring, Alerting, and Operational Visibility

---

## 1. Purpose

The Cross-Domain Monitoring Framework provides a comprehensive, consistent approach to monitoring, alerting, and operational visibility across all VeritasVault domains. It ensures complete coverage of system health, performance, and security with standardized metrics, health checks, and alerting.

## 2. Key Capabilities

* Standardized metrics collection and reporting
* Unified health check framework
* Consistent alerting with severity levels
* Cross-domain correlation of events
* Comprehensive operational dashboards
* Incident detection and response coordination

## 3. Core Components

### Metrics Management

* MetricsRegistry: Centralized definition and tracking of system metrics
* MetricsCollector: Standardized metrics collection from all domains
* MetricsStorage: Time-series storage for historical analysis
* MetricsExporter: Integration with monitoring systems

### Health Monitoring

* HealthCheckService: Standardized health monitoring across domains
* HealthCheckRegistry: Registration and discovery of health checks
* HealthStatus: Consistent health status reporting
* DependencyHealth: Monitoring of external dependencies

### Alerting

* AlertingService: Unified alerting with consistent severity levels
* AlertRule: Definition of alert conditions and thresholds
* AlertNotification: Delivery of alerts to appropriate channels
* AlertEscalation: Automated escalation of critical alerts

### Visualization

* DashboardService: Comprehensive monitoring dashboards
* DashboardTemplate: Standardized dashboard layouts
* VisualizationComponent: Reusable visualization components
* CrossDomainView: Integrated view across domain boundaries

### Incident Management

* IncidentDetection: Automated incident identification
* IncidentResponseCoordinator: Cross-domain incident management
* IncidentPlaybook: Predefined response procedures
* PostMortemTemplate: Standardized incident analysis

## 4. Integration Model

Each domain implements standardized monitoring interfaces:

* **IMetricsProvider**: Exposes domain-specific metrics
* **IHealthCheck**: Implements health checks for domain components
* **IAlertSource**: Defines domain-specific alert conditions
* **IIncidentHandler**: Handles domain-specific incident response

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### Metrics Standards

* Naming convention: `domain.component.metric_name`
* Standard units and dimensions
* Required metadata (service, instance, version)
* Performance impact considerations

### Health Check Implementation

* Standardized status codes (OK, WARNING, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN)
* Timeout and failure handling
* Dependency health propagation
* Scheduled vs. on-demand checks

### Alerting Best Practices

* Alert severity definitions (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
* Alert grouping and correlation
* Noise reduction strategies
* Actionable alert content

### Dashboard Organization

* Domain-specific dashboards
* Cross-domain overview dashboards
* User role-based views
* Drill-down capabilities
