# Monitoring Architecture

> Core components and implementation of the monitoring system

---

## 1. Overview

The Monitoring Architecture provides the foundation for comprehensive visibility into system health, performance, and operational status. This document outlines the core components, data flows, and implementation guidelines for the monitoring infrastructure.

## 2. Core Components

### Monitoring Components

* **MetricCollector:** Gathers system, application, and business metrics
* **LogAggregator:** Centralizes and processes log data from all components
* **HealthChecker:** Performs active probing of system components
* **DashboardEngine:** Visualizes operational state and metrics
* **AnomalyDetector:** Identifies unusual patterns and potential issues

### Monitoring Topology

* **Collection Layer:**
  * Agent-based collection for host-level metrics
  * API-based collection for service metrics
  * Log shipping for application logs
  * Synthetic transactions for end-to-end testing

* **Processing Layer:**
  * Stream processing for real-time metrics
  * Indexing and aggregation for logs
  * Correlation engine for event association
  * Anomaly detection for baseline deviation

* **Presentation Layer:**
  * Real-time dashboards for operational visibility
  * Historical trending for capacity planning
  * Alert consoles for incident management
  * SLA/SLO tracking for service performance

## 3. Monitoring Coverage

### Infrastructure Monitoring

* **Compute Resources:**
  * CPU, memory, disk utilization
  * Network throughput and latency
  * Container health and resource usage
  * Virtual machine performance

* **Storage Systems:**
  * Capacity utilization and growth trends
  * I/O performance and latency
  * Replication status and lag
  * Backup success and recovery readiness

* **Network Infrastructure:**
  * Throughput, packet loss, latency
  * Connection states and saturation
  * DNS resolution performance
  * Load balancer health and distribution

### Application Monitoring

* **Service Health:**
  * Availability and uptime
  * Error rates and types
  * Request latency percentiles
  * Throughput and capacity

* **API Monitoring:**
  * Request volumes by endpoint
  * Success/failure rates
  * Response time distribution
  * Rate limiting and throttling status

* **Database Performance:**
  * Query performance and execution time
  * Connection pool utilization
  * Lock contention and deadlocks
  * Index usage and optimization

### Integration-Specific Monitoring

* **Bridge Monitoring:**
  * Cross-chain message status and latency
  * Validator consensus metrics
  * Finality confirmation times
  * Failed/pending transaction counts

* **Oracle Monitoring:**
  * Price feed freshness and deviation
  * Source consensus and variance
  * Update frequency and gaps
  * Anomaly detection for price movements

* **Message Bus:**
  * Queue depths and processing rates
  * Dead letter queue size and trends
  * Message delivery latency
  * Duplicate detection rate

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### Technical Stack

* **Time-Series Database:** InfluxDB/Prometheus for metric storage
* **Log Management:** Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana (ELK) stack
* **APM Solution:** Application performance monitoring tools
* **Visualization:** Grafana dashboards with custom panels
* **Alerting:** AlertManager with multiple notification channels

### Data Collection Standards

* **Metric Naming Convention:**
  * Format: `domain.component.metric_name`
  * Example: `integration.bridge.message_count`
  * Include relevant tags/dimensions for filtering

* **Log Format:**
  * Structured JSON logging
  * Required fields: timestamp, service, level, message, trace_id
  * Contextual fields for specific events

* **Health Check Implementation:**
  * Standardized health endpoints (`/health`)
  * Status categories: healthy, degraded, unhealthy
  * Detailed component health reporting

### Storage & Retention

* **Hot Metrics:** 7 days of high-resolution data
* **Warm Metrics:** 30 days of aggregated data
* **Cold Metrics:** 1 year of summary data
* **Critical Logs:** 90 days online, 7 years archived
* **Operational Logs:** 30 days online, 1 year archived

## 5. Dashboard Framework

### Standard Dashboards

* **System Overview:** High-level health and performance
* **Component Dashboards:** Detailed metrics for each component
* **Business Metrics:** KPIs and business-relevant indicators
* **Operational Dashboards:** For on-call and incident response
* **Capacity Planning:** Trend analysis and forecasting

### Dashboard Design Principles

* **Hierarchy of Information:** Most critical metrics prominently displayed
* **Consistent Layout:** Standardized layout across dashboards
* **Context Preservation:** Maintain context when drilling down
* **Actionability:** Link metrics to relevant runbooks/alerts
* **Performance:** Optimize dashboard load times and refresh rates
