# Performance Benchmarks

> Comprehensive performance criteria, metrics, and validation framework

---

## 1. Overview

The Performance Benchmarks framework establishes the standard performance criteria, testing methodologies, and validation procedures for the VeritasVault platform. This document serves as an entry point to our performance standards and testing framework, with detailed specifications split into specialized areas.

## 2. Benchmark Categories

Our performance benchmarks are organized into the following categories:

* **Throughput Benchmarks** - Transaction processing capacity and message handling rates
* **Latency Benchmarks** - Response time and processing delay standards
* **Scalability Benchmarks** - Performance characteristics under varying loads
* **Resilience Benchmarks** - System behavior under stress and recovery patterns
* **Efficiency Benchmarks** - Resource utilization and optimization metrics

## 3. Documentation Structure

To maintain clarity and specialization, our performance benchmarks are split into focused files:

* [API Performance](./benchmarks/api-performance.md) - Gateway and service API performance standards
* [Bridge Performance](./benchmarks/bridge-performance.md) - Cross-chain transaction benchmarks
* [Data Processing](./benchmarks/data-processing.md) - Analytics and data pipeline metrics
* [Storage Performance](./benchmarks/storage-performance.md) - Database and storage system benchmarks
* [Resource Utilization](./benchmarks/resource-utilization.md) - Compute and memory efficiency standards

## 4. Key Performance Indicators

### Throughput KPIs

* **Transaction Processing Rate:** 
  * Standard: 1,000 TPS sustained, 5,000 TPS peak
  * Critical: 500 TPS minimum acceptable threshold
  * Target: 2,000 TPS by Q4 2025

* **Message Processing:**
  * Standard: 10,000 messages per second
  * Critical: 2,500 messages per second minimum
  * Target: 25,000 messages per second by Q3 2025

### Latency KPIs

* **API Response Time:**
  * Standard: 95% of requests < 250ms
  * Critical: 99% of requests < 1000ms
  * Target: 95% of requests < 100ms by Q2 2025

* **End-to-End Transaction Time:**
  * Standard: 95% of transactions < 2 seconds
  * Critical: 99% of transactions < 5 seconds
  * Target: 95% of transactions < 1 second by Q4 2025

### Scalability KPIs

* **Linear Scaling Factor:**
  * Standard: 0.8 (80% efficiency with resource doubling)
  * Critical: 0.6 minimum acceptable scaling factor
  * Target: 0.9 by Q1 2026

* **Maximum Scale Testing:**
  * Standard: Stable at 10x normal load
  * Critical: Functional at 5x normal load
  * Target: Stable at 20x normal load by Q2 2026

## 5. Testing Framework

Our performance testing framework employs multiple methodologies:

* **Load Testing** - Validates system behavior under expected usage patterns
* **Stress Testing** - Evaluates system limits and breaking points
* **Endurance Testing** - Verifies performance stability over extended periods
* **Spike Testing** - Assesses system response to sudden load increases
* **Scalability Testing** - Measures performance across different resource configurations

For detailed testing protocols and tools, see [Testing Methodologies](./benchmarks/testing-methodologies.md).

## 6. Performance Monitoring

Performance benchmarks are continuously validated through:

* **Continuous Performance Testing** - Automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline
* **Synthetic Transaction Monitoring** - Simulated user interactions in production
* **Real-time Performance Dashboards** - Live monitoring of key metrics
* **Trend Analysis** - Long-term performance pattern evaluation

For integration with operational monitoring, see [Operational Monitoring](./operational-monitoring.md).
