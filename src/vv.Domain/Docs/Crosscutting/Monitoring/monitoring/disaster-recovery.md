# Disaster Recovery

> Comprehensive strategy for recovering from major service disruptions

---

## 1. Overview

The Disaster Recovery (DR) framework provides a structured approach to preparing for, responding to, and recovering from major service disruptions that exceed the scope of normal incident response. This document outlines the DR strategy, recovery objectives, procedures, and testing methodologies for ensuring business continuity of the VeritasVault platform.

## 2. Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The maximum acceptable time between service disruption and restoration:

  * Bridge functionality
  * Price Oracle services
  * Core transaction processing

* **Tier 2 (Essential):** < 2 hours
  * Message Bus services
  * API Gateway functionality
  * Identity & Access services

* **Tier 3 (Important):** < 8 hours
  * Analytics processing
  * Reporting services
  * Administrative interfaces

* **Tier 4 (Non-critical):** < 24 hours
  * Historical data access
  * Development environments
  * Non-essential dashboards

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The maximum acceptable data loss measured in time:

* **Tier 1 (Critical):** 0 minutes (zero data loss)
  * Financial transactions
  * Cross-chain messages
  * Price feed data

* **Tier 2 (Essential):** < 5 minutes
  * User configuration changes

### Service Level Objectives (SLO)

Target availability levels during normal operations:

* **Tier 1 (Critical):** 99.99% (≈ 4.3 minutes downtime/month)
* **Tier 2 (Essential):** 99.95% (≈ 21.9 minutes downtime/month)
* **Tier 3 (Important):** 99.9% (≈ 43.8 minutes downtime/month)
