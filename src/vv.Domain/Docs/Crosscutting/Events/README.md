# VeritasVault Standardized Event Schema

> Consistent Event Structure and Versioning Across Domains

---

## 1. Purpose

The Standardized Event Schema provides a unified approach to event definition, structure, and handling across all VeritasVault domains. It ensures consistency, interoperability, and reliable event processing throughout the system.

## 2. Key Capabilities

* Consistent event structure across domains
* Explicit versioning and compatibility
* Standardized metadata for all events
* Schema validation and enforcement
* Event correlation and tracing
* Reliable event routing and delivery

## 3. Core Components

### Base Event Structure

* **BaseEvent**: Common properties for all events
  * EventId: Unique identifier for the event
  * Timestamp: When the event occurred
  * Version: Schema version for compatibility
  * Source: Domain and component that generated the event
  * CorrelationId: For tracking related events
  * CausationId: For tracking event chains

### Domain-Specific Events

* **DomainEvent**: Base class for domain-specific events
  * Extends BaseEvent with domain context
  * Includes domain-specific metadata
  * Maintains domain integrity constraints
  * Supports domain-specific validation

### Event Envelope

* **EventEnvelope**: Wrapper for event routing and metadata
  * Routing information
  * Security context
  * Delivery guarantees
  * Retry policies
  * Expiration settings

## 4. Schema Definition

### Event Schema Registry

* Central repository for all event schemas
* Version history and compatibility matrix
* Schema validation tools
* Documentation generation

### Schema Evolution

* Backward compatibility requirements
* Forward compatibility guidelines
* Breaking vs. non-breaking changes
* Migration paths for schema updates

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### Event Design Principles

* Events should be immutable
* Include all relevant data in the event
* Avoid references to external systems
* Design for idempotent processing
* Consider event size and performance impact

### Naming Conventions

* Event names should be past tense (e.g., AssetCreated)
* Clear, descriptive names that indicate what happened
* Consistent naming patterns across domains
* Namespace conventions for domain separation

### Versioning Strategy

* Semantic versioning for event schemas
* Explicit version in event metadata
* Compatibility annotations
* Version negotiation mechanisms

## 6. Cross-Domain Event Handling

### Event Routing

* Topic naming conventions
* Routing based on event type and content
* Filtering and subscription patterns
* Dead letter handling for undeliverable events

### Event Processing

* Idempotent event handlers
* Retry strategies
* Error handling and recovery
* Event ordering and sequencing

## 7. Integration with Existing Events

The standardized event schema builds on existing event implementations like MarketDataChangedEvent, providing a consistent structure while maintaining domain-specific functionality:

```csharp
// Example based on existing MarketDataChangedEvent
public class MarketDataChangedEvent<T> : BaseEvent where T : IMarketDataEntity
{
    // Common properties from BaseEvent
    // - EventId
    // - Timestamp
    // - Version
    // - Source
    // - CorrelationId
    // - CausationId

    // Domain-specific properties
    public T Data { get; }
    public ChangeType ChangeType { get; }

    public MarketDataChangedEvent(T data, ChangeType changeType = ChangeType.Updated)
    {
        Data = data ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(data));
        ChangeType = changeType;
        
        // Initialize base properties
        EventId = Guid.NewGuid();
        Timestamp = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;
        Version = "1.0";
        Source = "Asset.MarketData";
    }
}
```
