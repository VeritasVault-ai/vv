* Automated upgrade, migration, and rollback capabilities.
* Integrated custody, treasury, and insurance logic for digital assets.
* On-chain arbitration and dispute resolution for institutional risk management.

## Timeline Impact

* Phase 1 MVP: GovernanceController, Proposal & Vote mechanics, and ParameterStore.
* Phase 2: UpgradeController, scheduled tasks, and dispute management.
* Phase 3: Treasury, InsuranceFund, and EscrowController deployment.
* Phase 4: Full automation, scalability, and regulatory response improvements.

# 3. Domain Overview

The Governance, Ops & Custody domain is the backbone of protocol integrity, upgradeability, treasury, and custodial operations in VeritasVault. It implements the full lifecycle for governance, voting, upgrades, fund flows, insurance, and on-chain dispute management, ensuring institutional-grade safety and compliance.

# 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

## Core Functions

* DAO proposal and voting lifecycle
* Parameter management and on-chain configuration
* Secure contract upgrade and rollback
* Treasury and insurance fund custody
* On-chain task scheduling and automation
* Dispute, slashing, and arbitration
* Multi-sig and escrow operations

## Scope Definition

* **In Scope:**

  * GovernanceController, ParameterStore, UpgradeController, Treasury, InsuranceFund, TaskScheduler, DisputeManager, EscrowController
* **Out of Scope:**

  * Application-layer UIs, third-party custody services, fiat on/off-ramp logic

# 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

## Aggregate Roots

* **Proposal:** Governance proposals, lifecycle, and parameter changes.
* **Vote:** Aggregate for voting, delegation, and outcomes.
* **Upgrade:** Upgrades, rollbacks, and version state.
* **TreasuryAsset:** Treasury/insurance assets, grant tracking, and fund status.
* **Dispute:** On-chain arbitration and fraud proof lifecycle.
* **EscrowLock:** Multi-sig and time-locked asset custody.

## Entities

* **Parameter:** On-chain parameters and historical versions.
* **InsuranceClaim:** Funded claims, proof, and dispute linkage.
* **ScheduledTask:** Automation and maintenance jobs.

## Value Objects

* **ProposalStatus:** Enum for proposal/vote/upgrade lifecycle.
* **ParameterKey:** Key for parameter management.
* **DisputeStatus:** Enum for dispute/arbitration outcomes.
* **EscrowCondition:** Immutable custody criteria.

## Domain Events

* **ProposalCreated:** Triggered on new proposals or upgrades.
* **VoteCast:** On voting or delegation events.
* **ParameterUpdated:** On configuration changes.
* **UpgradeExecuted:** On upgrades/rollbacks.
* **TreasuryFunded:** Funding events for treasury/insurance.
* **ClaimProcessed:** Insurance claim outcomes.
* **TaskScheduled:** Automation job activation.
* **DisputeResolved:** On final arbitration outcome.
* **EscrowReleased:** On custody/unlock events.

## Repository Contracts

* **IProposalRepository:** Proposals, upgrades, and voting.
* **IParameterRepository:** Parameter state/history management.
* **IUpgradeRepository:** Version, migration, rollback tracking.
* **ITreasuryRepository:** Treasury and insurance funds.
* **IDisputeRepository:** Dispute and claim lifecycle management.
* **IEscrowRepository:** Custody, locks, and release history.

## Invariants / Business Rules

* No upgrade/parameter change without governance approval.
* Proposals require voting, quorum, and majority logic.
* No claim/treasury action without signed, auditable proof.
* Disputes/arbitration require event-sourced proofs and resolution logic.
* Escrow requires multi-sig, time locks, and immutable release conditions.

# Implementation Strategy: Phased Delivery

## Phase 1 – Foundation & Architecture

* Deploy GovernanceController, Proposal, Vote, and ParameterStore with audit trail.

## Phase 2 – MVP & Testbed

* UpgradeController, TaskScheduler, and DisputeManager (base logic & security review).

## Phase 3 – Expansion & Robustness

* Treasury, InsuranceFund, EscrowController. Automation, audit, and advanced scenarios.

## Phase 4 – LIVE Production Launch

* Institutional scaling, cross-chain governance, regulatory triggers, and DR.
