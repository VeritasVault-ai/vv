# VeritasVault Protocol Governance & Management

> Protocol Governance, Operations, and Asset Management

## 1. Overview

Defines the full-stack, on-chain governance, treasury, and protocol operations for VeritasVault. All changes, votes, assets, and upgrades are auditable and time-locked. No off-chain "wink and nudge" governance—just provable, contract-enforced rule of law.

## 2. Domain Model & Responsibilities

### A. Governance Domain

#### 1. GovernanceController

**Purpose**: Protocol-wide proposal, voting, and delegation management.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage proposal lifecycle (creation, queue, vote, execute)
- Control on-chain voting and delegate management
- Coordinate parameter updates with full audit trails
- Enforce quorum, time locks, and multi-sig on critical ops

```solidity
interface IGovernance {
    struct Proposal {
        bytes32 id;
        address proposer;
        string description;
        bytes[] actions;
        uint256 startBlock;
        uint256 endBlock;
        uint256 requiredQuorum;
        mapping(address => bool) votes;
        ProposalState state;
    }

    enum ProposalState {
        Pending,
        Active,
        Canceled,
        Defeated,
        Succeeded,
        Queued,
        Expired,
        Executed
    }

    function propose(
        string calldata description,
        bytes[] calldata actions
    ) external returns (bytes32);

    function castVote(bytes32 proposalId, bool support) external;
    function delegate(address delegatee) external;
    function execute(bytes32 proposalId) external;

    // Parameter management
    function setParameter(bytes32 paramId, bytes calldata value) external;
    function getParameter(bytes32 paramId) external view returns (bytes memory);
}

interface IParameterStore {
    event ParameterUpdated(bytes32 indexed paramId, bytes value);

    function updateParameter(
        bytes32 paramId,
        bytes calldata value,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external;

    function getParameter(bytes32 paramId) external view returns (bytes memory);
    function validateUpdate(bytes32 paramId, bytes calldata value) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### B. Treasury & Insurance Domain

#### 2. Treasury

**Purpose**: Central protocol asset and reserve manager.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage all protocol assets, endowments, and reserves
- Approve DAO grant disbursement and spend proposals
- Track and audit all inflows/outflows

#### 3. InsuranceFund

**Purpose**: Protocol-level risk coverage and claims system.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage insurance/coverage pools
- Calculate premiums and validate claims
- Process payouts, handle emergency coverage

### C. Protocol Management Domain

#### 4. UpgradeController

**Purpose**: Secure, auditable contract upgrade/migration system.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Propose, approve, and execute upgrades and rollbacks
- Handle user state migration and contract proxy logic
- Enforce upgrade/versioning policies

```solidity
interface IUpgradeController {
    struct Upgrade {
        bytes32 id;
        address[] targets;
        address[] implementations;
        bytes[] migrationData;
        bool requiresUserMigration;
    }

    function proposeUpgrade(Upgrade calldata upgrade) external returns (bytes32);
    function approveUpgrade(bytes32 upgradeId) external;
    function executeUpgrade(bytes32 upgradeId) external;
    function rollbackUpgrade(bytes32 upgradeId) external;

    // User state migration
    function migrateUserState(address user, bytes32 upgradeId) external;
    function verifyMigration(address user, bytes32 upgradeId) external view returns (bool);
}
```

#### 5. TaskScheduler

**Purpose**: Automation for recurring protocol tasks/events.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage cron/scheduled tasks, recurring jobs
- Coordinate system timeouts and trigger-based events

#### 6. DisputeManager

**Purpose**: On-chain arbitration and dispute resolution.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Handle challenge/appeal windows, fraud proofs, and claims
- Trigger slashing/penalties and audit all dispute outcomes

### D. Asset Custody Domain

#### 7. EscrowController

**Purpose**: On-chain, cross-chain, and time-locked asset custody/settlement.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage asset locks, releases, atomic swaps, and time locks
- Handle custody for bridge/settlement workflows
- Enforce emergency and multi-sig unlocks

```solidity
interface IEscrow {
    struct Lock {
        bytes32 id;
        address asset;
        uint256 amount;
        address owner;
        uint256 unlockTime;
        bytes32 condition;
        LockState state;
    }

    enum LockState {
        Active,
        Released,
        Refunded,
        Expired
    }

    function createLock(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 duration,
        bytes32 condition
    ) external returns (bytes32);

    function releaseLock(bytes32 lockId) external;
    function refundLock(bytes32 lockId) external;
    function extendLock(bytes32 lockId, uint256 extension) external;

    // Atomic swaps
    function createSwap(bytes32 lockIdA, bytes32 lockIdB) external returns (bytes32);
    function executeSwap(bytes32 swapId) external;
    function cancelSwap(bytes32 swapId) external;
}
```

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Governance Implementation

- Multi-sig required for all critical actions (proposals, upgrades, treasury ops)
- Time-locked execution and voting delays to prevent rushed changes
- On-chain delegation and vote tracking, no off-chain "soft votes"
- Emergency override with transparent post-mortem logging
- Clear upgrade paths for contracts, parameters, and state

### 2. Parameter Management

- Versioning and history for every protocol parameter
- Access controls (who can propose, who can execute)
- Validation on every update (format, range, policy compliance)
- Audit log for every change, revert, and challenge

### 3. Escrow Security

- Multi-signature enforcement on releases and swaps
- Mandatory time-locks on all custody operations
- Cross-chain proof requirement for all atomic swaps
- Emergency recovery protocols for stuck/failed states

## 4. Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Governance (Weeks 1-2)

- Deploy GovernanceController and ParameterStore with full access controls
- Onboard initial delegates, quorum parameters, and emergency policies
- Deploy core objects and events:
  - Objects: Proposal, Vote, Delegate, Parameter, GovernanceConfig, TimeDelay
  - Events: ProposalCreated, ProposalActivated, VoteCast, ProposalExecuted, DelegateChanged, ParameterUpdated, QuorumAdjusted

### Phase 2: Asset Management (Weeks 3-4)

- Launch Treasury and InsuranceFund for asset and risk management
- Deploy EscrowController for cross-chain custody workflows
- Deploy additional objects and events:
  - Objects: Asset, Reserve, Grant, Claim, InsurancePool, Premium, Lock, Swap, TimeCondition
  - Events: AssetRegistered, ReserveUpdated, GrantApproved, GrantRejected, ClaimFiled, ClaimProcessed, PremiumCollected, LockCreated, LockReleased, SwapExecuted

### Phase 3: Protocol Operations (Weeks 5-6)

- Bring up UpgradeController, TaskScheduler, and DisputeManager
- Integrate all logs, audits, and security checks
- Deploy advanced objects and events:
  - Objects: Upgrade, Migration, Version, Task, Schedule, Trigger, Dispute, Challenge, Appeal, Evidence
  - Events: UpgradeProposed, UpgradeApproved, MigrationCompleted, VersionUpdated, TaskScheduled, TaskExecuted, TaskCancelled, DisputeCreated, ChallengeSubmitted, AppealFiled, DisputeResolved

## 5. Security Considerations

### 1. Governance Security Considerations

- Quorum and voting delay to prevent rushed/hostile actions
- Execution timeouts and multi-sig on parameter/upgrade ops
- Emergency override and rollback with audit and disclosure

### 2. Parameter Security Considerations

- Versioning and strict access for updates
- Validation and update-frequency limits
- Full audit logging and real-time anomaly detection

### 3. Escrow Security Considerations

- Multi-sig for all custodial actions
- Enforced time locks and expiry policies
- Cross-chain verification for bridge/atomic ops
- Emergency unlock and dispute handling

## 6. Best Practices

- Every proposal, parameter, upgrade, and custody op is signed, versioned, and auditable
- Never allow off-chain governance for critical ops—on-chain only
- Emergency controls and rollbacks must be tested and reviewable
- No upgrade, release, or payout is ever final without full audit trail

If you don't trust your own governance, why would anyone else? Everything here is built for public scrutiny, hostile takeovers, and post-mortem survivability. Build your protocol like you expect someone to attack it—because they will.
