# VeritasVault Phase 1 (MVP) – Planning Timeline

---

## Overview

This timeline outlines the critical path, major milestones, dependencies, and success gates for Phase 1 (MVP) implementation across all VeritasVault domain artifacts. The plan is structured for rapid alignment, cross-team visibility, and MVP delivery discipline.

## Success Criteria (Phase 1 Gate)

* Core consensus, security, and asset modules functional and auditable
* Risk/compliance and AI/ML registry live
* Governance and integration gateways operational
* End-to-end system integration demonstrated
* Security, audit, and monitoring checks passed
* All critical API and contract interfaces version-controlled and tested

---

## Critical Risks (to monitor weekly)

* Environment or API delays (block downstream dev)
* Incomplete domain boundaries/integration
* Test coverage or audit logging gaps
* Stakeholder sign-off or feedback delays

---

## Notes

* All teams must align on API and event schemas early (before June 12)
* Security review is not a “side treatment”—start on day 1
* Continuous documentation: update artifacts with every milestone
* Plan for post-MVP backlog triage by July 10
