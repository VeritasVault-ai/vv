# VeritasVault Risk & Compliance

> Risk Management, Compliance, and Audit Systems

## 1. Overview

Defines the risk, compliance, and audit pillar of VeritasVault. The system is engineered to satisfy institutional and regulatory requirements for transparency, control, and provable compliance—no hand-waving, just audit trails regulators and adversaries can't punch holes in.

## 2. Domain Model & Responsibilities

### A. Risk & Compliance Domain

#### 1. RiskModel

**Purpose**: Centralized risk engine for real-time and scheduled analysis.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Calculate, aggregate, and store risk metrics and scores
- Enforce up-to-date risk policies (parameterized)
- Orchestrate multi-factor, cross-domain assessment workflows
- Maintain, version, and audit all deployed risk models

#### 2. RiskFactor

**Purpose**: Componentized analyzer for individual risk sources.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Analyze/score all market risks (volatility, price feeds, slippage)
- Evaluate credit/counterparty risk (exposure, creditworthiness, default probability)
- Assess oracle/third-party risks (source reliability, update lag)
- Monitor contract risks (upgrades, bugs, permission abuse, composability threats)

#### 3. ComplianceManager

**Purpose**: Regulatory compliance engine and reporting coordinator.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Generate and schedule compliance/attestation reports
- Maintain full audit trails and exportable reports for all activity
- Enforce regulatory, KYC/AML, and internal rules (configurable)
- Manage ongoing, periodic, and ad-hoc reporting schedules

#### 4. AuditLogger

**Purpose**: Immutable, cryptographic audit log and proof system.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Append-only event logs (all critical operations)
- Generate signed attestations for audit events
- Provide cryptographically verifiable proofs to auditors/regulators
- Archive and manage historical data with tamper-proof retention

## 3. Implementation Patterns

### Solidity Interface Examples

```solidity
interface IRiskModel {
    struct RiskAssessment {
        bytes32 id;
        uint256 riskScore;
        bytes32[] factors;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes evidence;
    }

    function assessRisk(bytes32 targetId) external returns (RiskAssessment memory);
    function updateRiskPolicy(bytes32 policyId, bytes calldata policy) external;
    function getRiskHistory(bytes32 targetId) external view returns (RiskAssessment[] memory);
}

interface IAuditLogger {
    function logEvent(
        bytes32 eventType,
        bytes calldata data,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external returns (bytes32);
    
    function verifyAuditTrail(bytes32 eventId) external view returns (bool);
    function getAuditProof(bytes32 eventId) external view returns (bytes memory);
}
```

## 4. Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Reporting

- Daily position/exposure reports
- Automated transaction monitoring
- Continuous risk exposure analysis
- Formal compliance attestations

### Audit Procedures

- Real-time event logging (all critical/regulated ops)
- Cryptographic (hash/signature) verification for all logs
- Tamper-proof data retention policies (no silent deletes/overwrites)
- Full access control logs (who, what, when, why)

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Risk Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)

- Deploy AuditLogger with immutable storage configuration
- Implement base RiskFactor components for market and counterparty risks
- Create foundational RiskModel with core assessment capabilities
- Deploy essential objects and events:
  - Objects: RiskAssessment, RiskPolicy, AuditRecord, RiskFactor
  - Events: RiskAssessmentCreated, PolicyUpdated, AuditLogCreated, FactorEvaluated

### Phase 2: Compliance & Reporting (Weeks 4-6)

- Deploy ComplianceManager with configurable rule engine
- Implement scheduled reporting infrastructure
- Integrate regulatory reporting templates
- Deploy additional objects and events:
  - Objects: ComplianceRule, ComplianceReport, ReportTemplate, RuleViolation
  - Events: RuleViolated, ReportGenerated, ComplianceStatusChanged, RuleUpdated

### Phase 3: Advanced Risk & Audit (Weeks 7-9)

- Implement cross-domain risk assessment
- Deploy advanced analytics and anomaly detection
- Create multi-chain audit verification
- Roll out comprehensive regulatory reporting
- Deploy advanced objects and events:
  - Objects: CompositeRiskScore, AnomalyDetection, RiskDashboard, AuditProof
  - Events: AnomalyDetected, RiskThresholdBreached, CrossDomainAssessmentCompleted, AuditProofGenerated

## 6. Best Practices

1. **Defense-in-Depth**: All risk and compliance operations are logged and signed; no off-ledger fudge factors.
2. **Factorization**: Risk analysis must be multi-dimensional; single-factor scores are forbidden.
3. **Immutable Audit**: All audit trails must be append-only and cryptographically provable to third parties.
4. **Policy Versioning**: Every risk/compliance policy is versioned and referenceable in any report.
5. **Automated Reporting**: Never trust a manual report—full automation with operator override only in documented emergencies.
6. **Access Control**: All critical actions require role-based authentication; logs are included in every audit/export.

## 7. Security & Threat Considerations

| Threat Type             | Vector/Scenario                  | Mitigation/Control                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Risk Model Evasion      | Manual overrides, hidden flows   | Immutable logs, signed attestations            |
| Audit Tampering         | Log manipulation, silent edit    | Append-only, cryptographic proofs, access logs |
| Compliance Gaps         | Out-of-date rules, missed events | Policy versioning, automated triggers          |
| Data Retention Failure  | Silent deletes, selective loss   | Tamper-proof storage, regular audits           |
| Regulatory Blacklisting | Report inaccuracies, delay       | Real-time, automated reporting                 |

## 8. Integration & Composition

- Risk and audit logs are integrated with every critical system (core infra, AI/ML, finance, ops).
- ComplianceManager and AuditLogger are accessible to external regulators with full proof.
- Reports and risk assessments are exportable (PDF, JSON, XBRL, etc.), signed and timestamped.

In this stack, risk and compliance aren't "side features"—they are existential requirements. No shortcuts, no plausible deniability. If it isn't logged, it didn't happen.
