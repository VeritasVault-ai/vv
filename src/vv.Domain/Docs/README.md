## Overview

VeritasVault is an institutional-grade decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed for high-security, auditable, and compliant financial operations. The platform serves institutional investors, regulatory bodies, and DeFi protocols by providing:

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Asset Trading & Settlement**: Atomic, auditable asset trading with portfolio management and risk controls
- **AI-Powered Risk Management**: Real-time risk assessment using machine learning models with continuous bias monitoring
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Secure bridges and adapters for multi-blockchain operations
- **Governance & Treasury**: DAO-based governance with automated treasury management and upgrade capabilities
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated compliance reporting, immutable audit trails, and regulatory attestation

**Target Users:**
- **Institutional Investors**: Requiring enterprise-grade security, compliance, and audit capabilities
- **Regulators & Auditors**: Needing transparent, immutable audit trails and compliance reporting
- **DeFi Protocols**: Seeking secure integration and cross-chain interoperability
- **AI/ML Operators**: Deploying and managing models in production with fairness guarantees

The platform emphasizes "zero trust" security, where every action requires authentication, authorization, and audit logging. All operations are designed to be replayable, rollback-capable, and cryptographically verifiable.

## Domain Architecture

VeritasVault follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with clear separation of concerns across multiple bounded contexts. The codebase is organized into distinct domains, each with specific responsibilities:

### Domain Pillars

* [AI/ML Architecture Reference](./Domains/AI/README.md)
* [Asset & Trading Logic](./Domains/Asset/README.md)
* [Core Infrastructure](./Domains/Core/README.md)
* [External Interface](./Domains/ExternalInterface/README.md)
* [Governance & Upgrade Reference](./Domains/Governance/README.md)
* [Risk](./Domains/Risk/README.md)
* [Security](./Domains/Security/README.md)

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

* [Contracts](./Crosscutting/Contracts/README.md)
* [Monitoring Framework](./Crosscutting/Monitoring/README.md)
* [Event Schema](./Crosscutting/Events/README.md)

## Implementation Phases

The platform is implemented in four phases:
1. **Foundation**: Core infrastructure, consensus, basic security
2. **MVP**: Asset trading, risk management, integration gateway
3. **Advanced**: AI/ML domain, governance, cross-chain capabilities
4. **Production**: Full operationalization, monitoring, compliance automation

## Glossary of Codebase-Specific Terms

### Core Infrastructure
- **`ConsensusManager`**: Manages blockchain finality and transaction inclusion
- **`ChainIndexer`**: Indexes blocks and creates state snapshots for replayability
- **`EventEmitter`**: Emits, stores, and replays cryptographically signed domain events
- **`CircuitBreaker`**: Monitors state transitions for rate/gas/incident conditions and auto-pauses operations

### Asset Trading & Settlement
- **`OrderBook`**: Deterministic FIFO order matching with concurrency versioning
- **`Portfolio`**: Multi-asset basket manager with position limits and risk validation
- **`Settlement`**: Atomic trade finalization with cryptographic proofs
- **`TradeExecution`**: Executes trades with compliance validation and proof generation

### AI/ML Domain
- **`GlobalModelRegistry`**: Central repository for AI model registration, versioning, and dependencies
- **`ContinuousFairnessController`**: Monitors bias/drift and enforces fairness constraints on ML models
- **`SecurityController`** (AI): Handles AI-specific incident detection and automated rollback
- **`ModelDeploymentController`**: Manages shadow/canary/production deployment pipeline for ML models
- **`OperatorStakingController`**: Economic security through operator staking and slashing mechanisms

### Risk & Compliance
- **`RiskModel`**: Centralized engine for real-time, multi-factor risk assessment
- **`ComplianceManager`**: Automated regulatory compliance enforcement and KYC/AML processing
- **`AuditLogger`**: Creates immutable, cryptographically signed audit trails
- **`RiskFactor`**: Modular risk analysis components (market, counterparty, oracle, contract)

### External Interface
- **`APIGateway`**: Secure API perimeter with authentication, rate limiting, and circuit breakers
- **`AdapterManager`**: Manages external protocol adapters with sandboxing and lifecycle tracking
- **`MessageBus`**: Reliable event delivery with prioritization and dead-letter queues
- **`BridgeTransfer`**: Atomic cross-chain asset and message transfer with verification

### Security
- **`IdentityService`**: User and entity identity management
- **`AuthenticationService`**: Credential verification and session management
- **`AuthorizationService`**: Permission and access control
- **`AuditService`**: Immutable audit logging across all domains

### Governance & Treasury
- **`GovernanceController`**: DAO proposal lifecycle management with timelock enforcement
- **`TreasuryAdvanced`**: Portfolio strategy implementation with automated rebalancing
- **`UpgradeController`**: Protocol upgrade management with automated rollback capabilities
- **`EscrowController`**: Multi-sig and time-locked custody for on-chain asset management

### Key Interfaces & Patterns
- **`IEnhanced*`**: Enhanced interfaces with additional security/audit capabilities
- **Zero Trust**: Security model requiring verification for every action regardless of source
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as immutable, replayable event sequences
- **Aggregate Root**: DDD pattern for maintaining consistency boundaries around related entities
- **Repository Contract**: Abstraction layer for data access with audit and versioning support
