# 2. Executive Summary

## Business Impact

* Provides the secure, verifiable chain infrastructure for all VeritasVault protocol domains.
* Enables transparent, auditable, and robust block finalization, data integrity, and event-driven workflows.
* Foundation for regulatory compliance, operational resilience, and long-term protocol upgrades.

## Technical Impact

* Defines all chain state as domain-driven aggregates and events.
* Supports replayable, event-sourced state with high testability and reliability.
* Decouples consensus, indexing, and event logic for extensibility and maintainability.

## Timeline Impact

* Phase 1 (MVP): Chain finalization, indexing, event emission—by 7 June 2025.
* Phases 2–4: Layer in security, cross-chain, governance, and upgrade logic over subsequent quarters.

# 3. Domain Overview

The Core Infrastructure domain implements the foundational, DDD-aligned state, event, and consensus logic that underpins every transaction and contract in VeritasVault. It ensures all protocol activity is final, indexed, and fully auditable.

**Criticality: P0 (Mission Critical)**

---

# 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

## Core Functions

* Manage finalized chain state and enforce consensus invariants
* Index and snapshot all block data for replay and audit
* Emit, store, and replay key domain events
* Enforce chain data integrity and prevent double-finalization

## Scope Definition

**In Scope:**

* ConsensusManager, ChainIndexer, EventEmitter, domain data models, repository contracts, state/event log

**Out of Scope:**

* Business logic, application-level features, cross-chain/upgrade logic (Phase 3+), governance mechanisms

---

# 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

## Aggregate Roots

### BlockChain (Aggregate Root)

* Manages the lifecycle and state of the chain (blocks, finalization, consensus)
* Enforces invariants: one finalized block per height, no double-finalization, all state transitions event-sourced

### Block (Entity)

* Represents a finalized unit of chain state, with metadata and block hash

### BlockHeader (Entity)

* Encapsulates block metadata (number, timestamp, parent hash)

### StateSnapshot (Entity)

* Captures the chain state at a given finalized block

## Value Objects

* **ConsensusState:** Immutable object representing consensus at a specific block
* **BlockHash:** Unique identifier for blocks, derived from content

## Domain Events

* **BlockFinalized:** Emitted on successful finalization
* **BlockIndexed:** Emitted when a block is indexed for replay/audit
* **ChainReorg:** Emitted on chain reorganization events

## Repository Contracts

* **IBlockRepository:**

  * `saveBlock(Block block)`
  * `getBlockByHash(BlockHash hash)`
  * `getBlocksByHeight(uint256 height)`
  * `saveSnapshot(StateSnapshot snapshot)`
  * `getSnapshot(uint256 blockNumber)`

## Invariants / Business Rules

* Each block can only be finalized once
* Consensus state must always match the indexed chain
* Snapshots only created for finalized blocks
* All event emissions must be logged and replayable

# Implementation Strategy: Phased Delivery

## Phase 1 – Foundation & Architecture (MVP by 7 June 2025)

**Objective:**

* Deliver working, DDD-aligned finalized chain state, event emission, and indexing

**Deliverables:**

* Aggregate roots/entities/value objects/events as above
* IBlockRepository interface and implementation
* Unit and integration tests for all state transitions and events
* Initial architecture diagram (C4/mermaid)

## Phase 2 – Security & Control (August-September 2025)

* Add SecurityController, RateLimiter, GasController
* Emergency shutdown, rate limiting, gas policy enforcement

## Phase 3 – Cross-Chain & Oracle (October-November 2025)

* Add ChainAdapter, RandomnessOracle, cross-chain and VRF support

## Phase 4 – Governance & Upgrades (Jan-Feb 2026)

* Add ForkManager, GovernanceController, upgrade/version control

# Operations Guide (MVP)

* Monitoring: Chain state, finalization rate, event log replay
* Alerting: Block finalization failures, consensus mismatches
* Incident response: Manual intervention for missed blocks
* Maintenance: Repository backups, index verification

---

# Resource Planning (MVP)

* Block storage, snapshot storage, event log infrastructure
* Monitoring dashboard for chain state and events
* Estimated 2–3 engineers for MVP delivery and support

# Risk & Compliance (Ongoing, Per Phase)

| Phase | Risk               | Mitigation                 |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1     | Consensus failure  | Fallback/replay mechanisms |
| 2     | Security breach    | Multi-layer protection     |
| 3     | Cross-chain issues | Message verification       |
| 4     | Upgrade conflicts  | Compatibility testing      |

---

# Quality Assurance (MVP)

* Unit test coverage: >90%
* All aggregates/events covered in integration tests
* Manual review of event log replay and chain state

---

# Integration Guide

* API contracts for event log, block repository
* Integration points for SecurityController and future cross-chain logic
* Documentation of domain events and how they are consumed
