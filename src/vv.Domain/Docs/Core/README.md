## 1. Domain Overview

The Core Infrastructure provides the foundational layer for VeritasVault's AI/ML operations, ensuring secure, compliant, and verifiable AI model deployment and execution. It manages model lifecycle, security controls, governance rules, and operational monitoring across the entire system.

## 2. Responsibilities & Boundaries

* **Core Functions:**

  * Model registry and lifecycle management
  * Security and access control
  * Governance and compliance enforcement
  * Performance monitoring and optimization
  * Incident response coordination
  * Audit trail maintenance

* **Domain Boundaries:**

  * IN scope:

    * Core smart contracts
    * Security controls
    * Governance mechanisms
    * Monitoring systems
    * Audit logging

  * OUT scope:
    * Model implementation details
    * Business logic
    * UI/UX components
    * External integrations

## 3. Technical Architecture

* **Core Entities:**

  ```solidity
  interface IGlobalModelRegistry {
    struct ModelMetadata {
      bytes32 modelId;
      uint256 version;
      bytes32 implementationHash;
      address owner;
      ModelStatus status;
      uint256 lastUpdated;
      bytes32[] dependencies;
      mapping(bytes32 => uint256) thresholds;
    }

    struct ValidationResult {
      bytes32 modelId;
      uint256 timestamp;
      bool passed;
      bytes32 validatorId;
      bytes32 resultHash;
    }

    enum ModelStatus {
      Draft,
      Testing,
      Approved,
      Active,
      Deprecated
    }
  }

  interface ISecurityController {
    struct SecurityConfig {
      bytes32 modelId;
      uint256 minValidators;
      uint256 consensusThreshold;
      bytes32[] requiredChecks;
      mapping(bytes32 => uint256) limits;
    }
  }

  interface IGovernanceController {
    struct GovernanceParams {
      uint256 updateDelay;
      uint256 minApprovals;
      address[] approvers;
      bytes32[] requiredValidations;
    }
  }
  ```

* **Performance Specifications:**

  * Throughput: 1000+ model validations/hour
  * Latency: <500ms for critical operations
  * Resource usage: Optimized for distributed execution
  * Scalability: Linear scaling with validator count

## 5. Implementation Strategy

* **Deployment Plan:**

  1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Core contracts deployment
  2. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Security implementation
  3. Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Governance integration
  4. Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Monitoring system

* **Operations Guide:**

  * Monitoring:

    * Model status and health
    * Validator performance
    * Security metrics
    * Governance activities
  * Alerts:

    * Security violations
    * Performance degradation
    * Governance events
    * System failures

* **Resource Planning:**

  * Infrastructure:

    * Validator network
    * Storage nodes
    * Monitoring systems
  * Costs:

    * Operational: \$X/month
    * Scaling: \$Y/validator
    * Maintenance: Z hours/week
