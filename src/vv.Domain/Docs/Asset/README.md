# VeritasVault Asset & Trading

> Asset Management, Trading, and Settlement Systems

## 1. Overview

This domain defines all asset, liquidity, trading, and settlement logic for VeritasVault. It delivers institution-grade composability for asset management, high-assurance AMM design, precise trade execution, and robust cross-chain settlement. "Move fast and break things" does not apply here—integrity is non-negotiable.

## 2. Domain Model & Responsibilities

### A. Asset & Liquidity Domain

#### 1. Portfolio

**Purpose**: Multi-asset basket manager for portfolio construction and performance tracking.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage all open/closed asset positions
- Optimize allocations according to model/policy
- Track historical and real-time portfolio performance
- Execute and document rebalancing operations

#### 2. LiquidityPool

**Purpose**: Smart contract-powered, on-chain liquidity system (AMM).

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage reserve balances and LP token supply
- Implement/upgrade AMM math and logic
- Process token swaps atomically and with full accounting
- Assess, collect, and distribute fees transparently

#### 3. Asset

**Purpose**: Canonical representation of every supported asset.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Store asset metadata (type, decimals, price source, status)
- Control asset whitelisting/blacklisting
- Enforce asset lifecycle (creation, activation, deprecation)
- Track compliance and permission requirements

#### 4. LiquidityProvider

**Purpose**: Interface for LPs managing positions and rewards.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Track active LP stakes and reward shares
- Calculate, report, and distribute LP rewards
- Quantify impermanent loss per position
- Enforce vesting/unbonding as required

### B. Trading & Execution Domain

#### 5. TradeExecution

**Purpose**: Validate, match, and settle trades securely and transparently.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Validate trade intent, signature, and compliance
- Manage trade-matching (AMM or orderbook-based)
- Initiate atomic settlement flows
- Calculate and distribute trading/settlement fees

#### 6. OrderBook

**Purpose**: Classic limit order management with full auditability.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage order placement, cancellation, and update
- Match orders deterministically (FIFO/price-time)
- Handle partial and full fills, track order history
- Expose order state for external audits and compliance

#### 7. SettlementController

**Purpose**: Orchestrates post-trade settlement and guarantees finality.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Track and enforce settlement finality (on- and cross-chain)
- Coordinate transaction lifecycle (initiation, in-flight, settled, failed)
- Handle cross-chain atomic swaps and finality proofs
- Ensure settlement guarantees (escrow, rollback, fraud detection)

## 3. Implementation Patterns

### Solidity Interface Examples

```solidity
interface ITradeExecution {
    struct Trade {
        bytes32 id;
        address maker;
        address taker;
        address baseAsset;
        address quoteAsset;
        uint256 baseAmount;
        uint256 quoteAmount;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 status;
    }

    function executeTrade(Trade calldata trade) external returns (bool);
    function settleTrade(bytes32 tradeId) external returns (bool);
    function cancelTrade(bytes32 tradeId) external returns (bool);
}

interface ILiquidityPool {
    function addLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint256 amountA,
        uint256 amountB
    ) external returns (uint256 lpTokens);

    function removeLiquidity(
        uint256 lpTokens
    ) external returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB);

    function swap(
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn
    ) external returns (uint256 amountOut);
}
```

## 4. Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Asset Management (Weeks 1-3)

- Deploy Asset with whitelisting and metadata management
- Implement Portfolio with position tracking
- Establish asset lifecycle management
- Deploy core objects and events:
  - Objects: Asset, AssetMetadata, AssetStatus, Portfolio, Position, AllocationPolicy
  - Events: AssetCreated, AssetWhitelisted, AssetStatusChanged, PortfolioCreated, PositionOpened, PositionClosed, PortfolioRebalanced

### Phase 2: Liquidity Infrastructure (Weeks 4-6)

- Deploy LiquidityPool with AMM implementation
- Implement LiquidityProvider with staking and rewards
- Establish fee collection and distribution mechanisms
- Deploy additional objects and events:
  - Objects: LiquidityPool, PoolReserve, LPToken, LiquidityPosition, RewardShare, FeeStrategy, ImpermanentLossTracker
  - Events: PoolCreated, LiquidityAdded, LiquidityRemoved, SwapExecuted, FeeCollected, RewardDistributed, PositionStaked, PositionUnstaked

### Phase 3: Trading & Settlement (Weeks 7-10)

- Deploy TradeExecution with full matching capabilities
- Implement OrderBook with FIFO/price-time priority
- Establish SettlementController with cross-chain support
- Deploy advanced objects and events:
  - Objects: Trade, Order, OrderBook, SettlementRecord, CrossChainSwap, FinalityProof, SettlementGuarantee
  - Events: OrderPlaced, OrderCancelled, OrderMatched, TradeExecuted, TradeSettled, SettlementInitiated, SettlementCompleted, CrossChainSwapInitiated, FinalityProofVerified

## 5. Asset & Trading Best Practices

1. **Composability**: All components are contract-driven and upgradeable, never hard-coded.
2. **Deterministic Settlement**: No settlement without explicit, auditable finality.
3. **Fee Transparency**: All fees—swap, trade, withdrawal—must be deterministic and pre-disclosed.
4. **Atomicity**: No partial state: all state updates are atomic and revert on error.
5. **Order Book Integrity**: Orders must be auditable, non-malleable, and matched with clear deterministic logic.
6. **Cross-Chain Safety**: Cross-chain operations require proof-based atomicity and rollback on any failure.
7. **Reward/Airdrop Fairness**: LPs and traders must receive rewards proportionally and verifiably.
8. **Lifecycle Tracking**: All assets, orders, positions are versioned and referenceable in audits.

## 6. Security & Threat Considerations

| Threat Type              | Vector/Scenario                   | Mitigation/Control                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Pool Draining            | Re-entrancy, math bug, flash loan | Audited math, re-entrancy guards, circuit break |
| Trade Manipulation       | Sandwiching, frontrunning         | Fair matching, commit-reveal, time-weighting    |
| LP Reward Abuse          | Fake liquidity, flash staking     | Minimum vesting, time-weighted rewards          |
| Settlement Failure       | Chain reorg, cross-chain bug      | Finality proofs, rollback/escrow on fail        |
| Order Book Corruption    | Order spoofing/cancellation spam  | Rate limits, signature verification             |
| Asset Metadata Tampering | Supply/decimals/whitelist fraud   | Immutable metadata hash, multi-sig updates      |

## 7. Integration & Composition

- Asset, portfolio, and trading modules are cross-integrated and callable by all other domains (risk, compliance, AI/ML).
- Liquidity and trade settlement integrate directly with cross-chain/finality controllers.
- All on-chain activity is signed, timestamped, and available for audit.

## 8. References & Resources

- Liquidity Pool Spec
- Trade Engine Reference
- Settlement Controller Guidelines

If you skip checks here, don't act shocked when you wake up to zero liquidity, corrupted portfolios, or front-run trades. Every operation must be traceable, auditable, and reversible where needed.
