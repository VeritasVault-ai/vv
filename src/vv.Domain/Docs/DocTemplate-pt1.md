# 2. Executive Summary

## Business Impact

* Summarize the expected effects on revenue, risk profile, compliance posture, market competitiveness, and user experience.

# 3. Domain Overview

Provide a clear and concise description of the domain's scope and its criticality within the platform. Articulate the purpose of this module or system and explain how it fits into the broader architectural vision.

---

# 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

## Core Functions

* List and briefly describe the essential responsibilities, duties, and objectives of this domain or module.

## Scope Definition

* **In Scope:**

  * Enumerate the primary elements, features, or capabilities covered by this documentation.
* **Out of Scope:**

  * Clearly state what is excluded from this domain to prevent ambiguity and maintain focus.

---

# 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

## Aggregate Roots

* \[Name]: Description of the aggregate root, its primary responsibilities, and the invariants it must enforce.

## Entities

* \[Name]: Define the relationship to the aggregate root, the principal mutable fields, and their roles in the domain.

## Value Objects

* \[Name]: Specify immutable properties and the context in which they are used within the domain model.

## Domain Events

* \[Name]: Describe the conditions that trigger each event, their payloads, and any expected side effects or workflows initiated.

## Repository Contracts

* \[Name]: List the core repository methods, strictly exposing aggregate roots only. Direct CRUD operations on entities or value objects are prohibited.

## Invariants / Business Rules

* Clearly articulate every critical business rule in plain, unambiguous language. Ensure each invariant maps to aggregate boundaries and is technically enforceable.
