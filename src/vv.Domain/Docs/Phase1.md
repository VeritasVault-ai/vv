# 2. Executive Summary

## Business Impact

* Ensures platform-wide security, resilience, and compliance—regardless of domain boundaries.
* Enables trust, operational continuity, and auditability for institutional and regulatory stakeholders.
* Minimizes systemic risks, downtime, and data integrity failures across VeritasVault.

## Technical Impact

* Establishes mandatory controls and processes (security, audit, monitoring) enforced at every architectural layer.
* Delivers continuous compliance, defense-in-depth, and zero trust posture for the entire protocol.
* Provides operational automation and observability, powering seamless upgrades, recovery, and performance optimization.

## Timeline Impact

* Phase 1: Security and monitoring framework baseline.
* Phase 2: Automated auditability and compliance controls.
* Phase 3: Performance, scaling, and resilience improvements.
* Phase 4: Full operationalization and continuous improvement cycle.

# 3. Domain Overview

The Cross-Cutting Concerns domain covers all aspects of VeritasVault that are foundational or shared between multiple domains. This includes security, monitoring, observability, audit, compliance, operational resilience, and regulatory conformance—designed to be non-optional and uniformly enforced.

---

# 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

## Core Functions

* Security framework (auth, access, encryption, multi-sig, circuit breakers)
* Audit logging and immutable record-keeping
* Monitoring and observability
* Compliance enforcement and attestation
* Disaster recovery, backup, and incident response
* Operational automation, upgrade, and rollback orchestration

## Scope Definition

* **In Scope:**

  * Security controls, audit logging, monitoring, compliance framework, DR, incident management, operational automation
* **Out of Scope:**

  * Domain-specific business logic, user-facing UI/UX, direct on-chain asset management

---

# 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

## Aggregate Roots

* **SecurityPolicy:** Platform-wide auth/access policy, multi-factor, circuit breaker state
* **AuditLog:** Immutable aggregate for all signed event and operational logs
* **ComplianceFramework:** Aggregate for all enforced standards and periodic attestations
* **RecoveryPlan:** Aggregate for disaster/incident response, backup, and restoration logic

## Entities

* **Alert:** Monitoring/threshold breach events
* **Incident:** Security or ops incident record
* **Backup:** Data and state backup events
* **UpgradeTask:** Operational or recovery automation step

## Value Objects

* **Signature:** Cryptographic signature of events/logs/actions
* **Threshold:** Alerting or operational escalation threshold
* **ComplianceStandard:** Immutable standard, version, or reference doc

## Domain Events

* **PolicyBreachDetected:** Any violation or trigger of a critical security/compliance policy
* **IncidentEscalated:** Major incident or attack escalated to key stakeholders
* **AuditRecordCreated:** Immutable operational or compliance event logged
* **BackupRestored:** Successful disaster recovery event

## Repository Contracts

* **ISecurityPolicyRepository:** Manage, retrieve, and enforce platform auth/access/circuit-breaker state
* **IAuditLogRepository:** Immutable audit event and log management
* **IComplianceFrameworkRepository:** Attestation, validation, and compliance proof management
* **IRecoveryPlanRepository:** Incident response, backup, and DR orchestration plans

## Invariants / Business Rules

* All actions require cryptographic signing and event logging.
* Policy breaches trigger automatic alerts and response workflows.
* All compliance attestation and audit logs must be immutable and tamper-proof.
* Backups/restores must be complete, versioned, and testable on demand.

# Implementation Strategy: Phased Delivery

## Phase 1 – Security & Monitoring Baseline

* Deploy core security controls (auth, encryption, circuit breakers)
* Establish baseline monitoring, alerting, and observability

## Phase 2 – Auditability & Compliance Automation

* Deploy immutable audit logs and compliance framework
* Automate periodic attestation and continuous compliance checks

## Phase 3 – Performance & Resilience

* Introduce advanced alerting, auto-remediation, and operational scaling
* Expand DR and incident recovery playbooks

## Phase 4 – Continuous Ops & Improvement

* Full operationalization of all controls
* Feedback-driven updates and new threat/standard integrations
