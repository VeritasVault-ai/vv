## VeritasVault Architecture – High-Level Overview

> End-to-End Institutional DeFi Platform

### What Is VeritasVault?

A modular, zero-compromise, institution-grade DeFi stack. Each domain is independently auditable, upgradeable, and designed to withstand both regulatory and adversarial conditions. No monolithic “black box” anywhere in the stack.

#### Cross-Cutting: Security & Best Practices

* **Defense-in-Depth:** Multi-layered controls, circuit breakers, multi-sig everywhere.
* **Auditability:** Every action, upgrade, and payout is signed, versioned, and auditable.
* **Zero Trust:** Every interface is authenticated, authorized, and monitored by default.
* **Composability:** Every module can stand alone or integrate, no forced coupling.
* **Regulatory-First:** Compliance is built-in, not retrofitted.

> **If you can’t prove it, you can’t do it. If you can’t audit it, it doesn’t exist. VeritasVault is engineered for chaos, scrutiny, and trustless operation—by design.**

---

## Purpose

The Domain Layer is the **bedrock** of VeritasVault’s modular, institution-grade DeFi architecture. It defines all business logic, contracts, value objects, and interfaces for the entire platform—including the AI/ML domain. Every policy, rule, entity, and event—if it isn’t enforced here, it isn’t real. No shortcuts, no ambiguity.

---

## Key Responsibilities

* **Defines Domain Models:** Canonical asset, risk, AI/ML, governance, integration, trading, custody, and more
* **Encodes Business Logic:** All protocol rules, invariants, and constraints
* **Contracts & Interfaces:** All external boundaries (infra, storage, analytics, governance, adapters)
* **Events & Value Objects:** Versioned, immutable, and auditable; every state transition is tracked
* **No External Dependencies:** No infrastructure, storage, or UI code—pure logic, pure rules

---

## Domain Structure

* **Core Infrastructure:** Finality, consensus, security, chain adaptation
* **Risk & Compliance:** Risk analytics, compliance logic, immutable audit trails
* **Asset & Trading:** Asset lifecycle, AMM logic, trading, and settlement
* **External Interface:** API gateway, bridges, oracles, adapters, analytics
* **Security:** Authentication, authorization, audit, threat detection
* **AI/ML:** Model registry, fairness, governance, operator incentives, deployment, and regulatory compliance
* **Governance & Ops:** On-chain voting, parameters, upgrades, treasury, custody, arbitration

> *Each folder maps to a primary vertical (business function). All cross-cutting concerns—security, audit, access control—are encoded directly into models or interfaces, never bolted on.*

---

## Design Principles

* **Onion/Clean/Hexagonal Architecture:** Domain is at the center; all dependencies point inward
* **Immutability & Auditability:** Every entity/event is versioned, logged, and provable
* **Explicit Boundaries:** No leaky abstractions; every interface is clear and contract-driven
* **Testability:** Pure business logic, easily testable in isolation
* **No Hand-Waving:** If it isn’t formalized here, it doesn’t exist at runtime

---

## Integration With Other Layers

* **Application Layer:** Implements use cases using domain contracts; no business logic leaks
* **Infrastructure Layer:** Storage, messaging, external protocols are adapters implementing domain interfaces
* **API Layer:** Only exposes what is allowed by the domain’s contracts and invariants

---

## Relationship with Other Projects

The AI/ML domain layer integrates with other components while maintaining the dependency rule of clean architecture:

* **vv.Application.AI**: Depends on Domain.AI. Implements use cases using the domain interfaces.
* **vv.Data.AI**: Implements repository interfaces from the domain.
* **vv.Infrastructure.AI**: Implements technical services for AI/ML operations.
* **vv.API.AI**: Exposes AI/ML capabilities through RESTful endpoints.

All dependencies point inward toward the domain, following the same patterns as the core Market Data domain.

---

## Best Practices

* **Never leak infrastructure or UI logic into the domain**
* **Unit test every business rule and contract edge case**
* **Version every event, contract, and parameter**
* **Security, access control, and audit are part of the contract, not afterthoughts**
* **Fail closed: Default to deny, not allow, on all domain contracts**
